  "bookDescription": "As Earth reaches back out to the stars, there are new ships.And new sheriffs.Riding a wave of exploration and profit, earth governments jockey for position in the new wild west—but there's danger. For every ship that leaves earth orbit, twenty arrive, and some have ill intent.Then, things get interesting.The Six Stars League is coming apart at the seams, and their actions require justice. When Van and the Fist intervene, they aren't alone—the GKU is there to lend a hand, and they arrive in new, lethal ships totally unknown to the Fist.With their secret navy, the GKU begins a competition for control of humanity among the stars—and seizure of the ultimate prize.Destroying the Stillness.For this job, Van will need bigger guns, a bigger ship, and more resolve. That means the Fafnir will be offline for a while, and other ships will have to step up. Enter Icky and Netty and the Fafnir Faithful, who decide that if one ship is good, then six ships is better.On the offensive, the Fist reaches across the stars to the distant Pleaides, deep in the big black where Stillness agents have reigned terror since Mark Tudor began his career. But if Van has learned anything, it's this:Being far from home means risk. And risk in deep space means death.But Van isn't going to fight alone, and Stillness are about to learn their final lesson.",

Despite bringing peace to many of the stars, the war has turned—and come home, bringing with it a new kind fight that Van knows all to well.Politics.With that brawl comes money, and with money, the fight gets serious. Retta's network reveals a threat rising in Europe, as various nations struggle to break free of earth, make bonds among the stars, and find new and exciting ways to turn the planet into something to be packaged and sold.For a profit, of course.Earth isn't the only world in danger, and a mystery in deepest space brings a strange connection to Perry's past—one that will unlock a second front on Van's war, all while opening the crew up to danger rooted in the halls of Anvil Dark.Anvil Dark, and the GKU aren't allies, not really, and Van is faced with old enemies and new recruits in a dirty fight for control of something that should belong to everyone—the law. Using technocrats, criminals, and opportunists, Van's enemies have bought their way into an alliance that will push the Fafnir and her crew into a battle for the ultimate control of earth's future——And the defense of earth will be waged as Van keeps one eye on deepest space, where an ancient enemy has awakened, eager for vengeance. Eager for the end of all life.And eager to end the Tudor line, once and for all.",

  "bookDescription": "After a risky hyperspace jump, Captain Archer Devereaux arrives in an uninhabited sector of the Orion Spur.He finds a long-abandoned ship with technology far advanced beyond any known in his region of space. Even more puzzling, the ship is of human construction. As the ship regains functionality, traps left by mutineers threaten the lives of Archer and the tiny crew aboard the derelict.When he succeeds in bringing Defender back to Alliance space, an idealistic scientist posts critical information regarding Defender’s advanced technology. The Nemeans and Scyllans press for peace talks—a delaying tactic while they evaluate the information dump. When they learn that implementation is at least a year away, they break the truce violently, attempting to capture the Alliance and EU delegates during peace talks on Earth.Archer suffers devastating losses in the attack, which he has difficulty processing emotionally. Bette has her own issues of this type, and the two part on uncertain terms. She then disappears, leaving a cryptic note.Defender’s Awakening is a pulse-pounding space opera of interstellar intrigue, moral dilemmas, and fragile emotional bonds. It’s perfect for fans of epic sci-fi adventures, where heroes must not only battle their foes but also control their hearts.Book 4 of a new military science fiction series from award-winning author John J. Spearman. It's perfect for fans of Rick Partlow, Nathan Lowell, and Jeffery H. Haskell!",

  "bookDescription": "Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is the winner of the Nebula and Hugo Awards In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.THE ENDER UNIVERSEEnder seriesEnder’s Game / Ender in Exile / Speaker for the Dead / Xenocide / Children of the MindEnder’s Shadow seriesEnder’s Shadow / Shadow of the Hegemon / Shadow Puppets / Shadow of the Giant / Shadows in FlightChildren of the FleetThe First Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)Earth Unaware / Earth Afire / Earth AwakensThe Second Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)The Swarm /The HiveEnder novellasA War of Gifts /First MeetingsAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

New powers are present now, ones that have travelled the length of the galaxy to bring salvation to the Imperium, though they are as readily cast as usurpers as redeemers. The survivors of the Traitors’ Grand Armada, now scattered and desperate to escape vengeance, are riven with doubt and dissension, and their gods too are silent. Amid all the grief and confusion, some hopeful souls believe the war to be over and an era of renewal just ahead. But wiser heads know that this war can never end, and that the only question remaining is who shall rise to power within the perilous new age, and who shall fall.Written by Chris Wraight.",

  "bookDescription": "They struck without warning. Now, survival depends on a man who’s never led.\nLieutenant Colonel Arthur Hanson was supposed to be an engineer, not a hero. Promoted to second-in-command aboard the CSV Margaret Thatcher, Arthur hoped for a quiet tour of duty—showing strength and keeping the peace.\nHe never expected a coordinated terrorist onslaught that would shatter the fleet and leave tens of thousands dead.\nWith the Thatcher crippled and reinforcements trapped behind political red tape, Arthur is thrust into command. Haunted by doubt but driven by duty, he must rally the broken survivors and strike back against a ruthless enemy who shows no mercy.\nBecause in the Orion Spur, freedom isn’t given. It’s fought for.\nAnd aboard a ship named after the Iron Lady herself, surrender is not an option.\nPerfect for fans of epic space battles, gritty heroes, and heart-pounding military science-fiction.",

It was his chance for redemption.\nUntil everything went wrong.\nThe cave should have been deserted. The perfect place to hide. Instead, it’s crawling with soldiers and engineers working to unearth the impossible:\nExcalibur.\nDeep beneath the mountain, she’s waited centuries to be found. Not a sword in the stone, but a starship. And according to the onboard AI, Thomas is the only one who can command her.\nNow he's on the run across a galaxy more astonishing and treacherous than he ever imagined, where magic and technology intertwine and ancient powers lurk in the shadows. Relentlessly hunted and hopelessly lost, he needs to learn fast if he wants to survive. Only his greatest challenge isn't training to pilot a starship. It's accepting that he, of all people, is responsible for reigniting the hope of a fallen kingdom.\nKing Arthur’s legend may be complete, but his is just beginning…",

  "bookDescription": "After daring escapes and narrow victories, Thomas finds himself not only as the commander of Excalibur, but a symbol of hope to a fledgling resistance movement determined to challenge Morgana’s tyrannical rule.\nThere’s a high price to freedom.\nHidden among the stars, Thomas and his crew must transform from fugitives into fighters, striking where the enemy least expects while gathering strength for the battles to come. Their quest will take them to ancient worlds where forgotten alliances wait to be rekindled, and secrets of both magic and technology lie guarded by those who remember Arthur's golden age.\nAs Morgana's elite hunters close in, Thomas must embrace a destiny larger than he ever imagined. For in a conflict where every victory demands sacrifice, even legendary starships and courageous hearts may not be enough to challenge a dark fate.\nThe resistance rises. The stars bear witness.",

  "bookDescription": "After a decade, acclaimed science fiction master John Scalzi returns to the galaxy of the Old Man's War series with the long awaited seventh book, The Shattering PeaceTHE PEACE IS SHATTERINGFor a decade, peace has reigned in interstellar space. A tripartite agreement between the Colonial Union, the Earth, and the alien Conclave has kept the forces of war at bay, even when some would have preferred to return to the fighting and struggle of former times. For now, more sensible heads have prevailed – and have even championed unity.But now, there is a new force that threatens the hard-maintained peace: The Consu, the most advanced intelligent species humans have ever met, are on the cusp of a species-defining civil war. This war is between Consu factions... but nothing the Consu ever do is just about them. The Colonial Union, the Earth and the Conclave have been unwillingly dragged into the conflict, in the most surprising of ways.Gretchen Trujillo is a mid-level diplomat, working in an unimportant part of the Colonial Union bureaucracy. But when she is called to take part in a secret mission involving representatives from every powerful faction in space, what she finds there has the chance to redefine the destinies of humans and aliens alike... or destroy them forever.OTHER TOR BOOKS BY JOHN SCALZIAgent to the StarsThe Android’s DreamFuzzy NationRedshirtsYour Hate Mail Will Be Graded:A Decade of Whatever, 1998–2008The Kaiju Preservation SocietyStarter VillainWhen the Moon Hits Your EyeTHE OLD MAN’S WAR NOVELSOld Man’s WarThe Ghost BrigadesThe Last ColonyZoë’s TaleThe Human DivisionThe End of All ThingsTHE LOCK IN SERIESLock InHead OnUnlockedTHE INTERDEPENDENCY SEQUENCEThe Collapsing EmpireThe Consuming FireThe Last EmperoxEDITED BY JOHN SCALZIMetatropolisAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

Who will lead the charge for justice—will it be Van and his trusted friends, or will the former GKU demand a seat at the table in a universe where nothing is ever settled, and old grudges don't die—they just linger?But old problems require new solutions, and Van sees the need for soldiers as an opportunity. From the growing ranks of the Shrikes, elite young leaders emerge, ready to answer the call when the Fist of Orion decides that sometimes, the best defense is a good offense.Teamed with the AnaDarko crew, the newest Peacemakers will begin using science as a tool—taking the fight to the Stillness wherever they are. But that means risk, and risk means conflict, and there's nothing messier than a family brawl when it comes to purging the stars of an ancient evil.Join Van and his crew as he learns that leading is harder than it looks, and sometimes, being true to yourself is the toughest fight of them all.",

His group of friends narrowly escaped when an alien ship used advanced technology to create tectonic instability on Noble Prime. Their alien weapon set off massive earthquakes that slaughtered thousands of international workers on the fringe world. And there’s no doubt that same nefarious aliens are working to isolate and slowly starve the entire human race.\nThe survivors from Noble Prime have one chance to prove to the world what is really going on. The psy-op war is happening whether people believe in it or not. But Zane and his friends will have to risk everything to pull off a nearly impossible mission, with no guarantees that it will work. But in times of desperate need, the courageous step up, and the best parts of humanity shine through.\nSiege is the stunning conclusion to the Alien Agenda trilogy. A fast-paced, space opera adventure set in the near future, Siege combines great characters with a frighteningly real scenario that feels as if it were ripped from the headlines. If you liked The X-Files, and The Expanse, you’ll love Siege and the entire Alien Agenda trilogy.",

And one way or another—it all ends here.From the fields of Iowa to deepest space, the final conflict will unfold with only one thing certain: Not everyone will survive, but Van will give his last breath to make certain that when future generations speak his name, they will always remember one fact.Until the end, he gave it all for justice, no matter the cost.",

  "bookDescription": "On a distant Earth colony, an orphaned survivor of an alien invasion discovers that the greatest world-ending dangers aren’t behind her.\nIt’s been eight years since an alien invasion drove a small surviving group of settlers to seek refuge in an underground shelter. Cut off from the rest of humanity, the ragtag band has maintained a narrowly functioning colony due to communal effort and salvage runs. Alex Archer has her own duties as a dog handler. While this off-world colony may be harsh, Ash, Alex’s black shepherd raised to sense threats, makes living in it a little nicer.\nBut the tenuous hide-and-seek with the monstrous species known as the Lankies is about to come to an end for Alex and her close-knit crew of soldiers, techs, and friends. When a salvage operation goes catastrophically wrong, the Lankies home in on the humans.\nWith hopes of a rescue long faded, all Alex has left is will—and the fear that there’s so much more to lose.",

A war like no other.\nWhen the research starship Galileo vanishes without a trace, the powers-that-be are quick to bury the incident, eager to prevent escalating tensions that could lead to war. As a former POW, Soren refuses to give the ship up for lost.\nHis daughter is one of the missing.\nTaking matters into his own hands, Soren starts pulling strings and calling in favors, determined to launch a clandestine mission to bring Galileo home. When an old friend offers him a ship for the operation, he expects a rusty relic headed for the scrapyard.\nInstead, he's given the Wraith—an unfinished, experimental starship with plenty of potential and just as many problems. A marvel of engineering…if his crew can keep her running.\nThey’d better.\nBecause Galileo’s disappearance is just the beginning. War is coming to the Federation from the most unlikely of places.\nAnd Soren may be the only one who can stop it.",

Though it’s not a heavy-hitting battlegroup, the light carriers and support vessels sailing through the wormhole are sufficient firepower to handle what’s left of the terrorists.\nBut overconfidence is their undoing.\nLeague-made heavy battle cruisers strike without warning and decimate the new arrivals, obliterating an unarmed hospital ship in the surprise attack. Arthur isn’t the only one who sees red as horrific losses pile up, the enemy seeming to anticipate their every FTL jump. With President Robbins refusing to send overwhelming force to end the conflict quickly, desperation drives Arthur to use any means necessary to gain intel from their war captive.\nAnd threats of mutiny once again gain steam.\nIntelligence collected under duress proves ineffective, while looming court martial brings Arthur to the breaking point. But it will take more than a crisis of conscience to see the conflict through to the bitter end against a dominating force.\nIt will take an iron will.",

  "bookDescription": "We were fighting on the wrong side, of a war we couldn't win. And that was the good news. The Ruhar hit us on Columbus Day. There we were, innocently drifting along the cosmos on our little blue marble, like the native Americans in 1492. Over the horizon come ships of a technologically advanced, aggressive culture, and BAM! There go the good old days, when humans only got killed by each other. So, Columbus Day. It fits. When the morning sky twinkled again, this time with Kristang starships jumping in to hammer the Ruhar, we thought we were saved. The UN Expeditionary Force hitched a ride on Kristang ships to fight the Ruhar, wherever our new allies thought we could be useful. So, I went from fighting with the US Army in Nigeria, to fighting in space. It was lies, all of it. We shouldn't even be fighting the Ruhar, they aren't our enemy, our allies are. I'd better start at the beginning....A selection of scenes from Columbus Day:There was a faint click, and the other door popped open a quarter inch. Cautiously, I pulled it open and stuck my head in. Beyond the door was a warehouse, maybe fifty feet by thirty, twenty feet tall, filled with racks of what I thought was mostly old, useless, dirty, dusty broken junk. I wandered in cautiously. Why the Ruhar had made the effort to store any of it made no sense to me. Surely there had to be something in there that I could use as a weapon.A man’s voice, with a snarky attitude, rang out behind me. “Excellent! Bipedal, 1300cc brain, opposable thumbs. A hairless monkey. You can carry me out of here.”I spun around in a panic. No one was there. “Who said that?”“Me. Here, I’m the shiny cylinder on the shelf. I unlocked that door.\"“You are? You mean you’re talking to me through a speaker in that thing?”“No, I am that thing. I am what you monkeys call an artificial intelligence.”I cocked my head and examined it skeptically. “You look like a chrome-plated beer can.\" That was a completely accurate description. The cylinder even tapered slightly at the top, and was ringed by a ridge. \"You’re really an AI?\"\"Yup. You should refer to me as The Lord God Almighty.”“That position is already filled. I think I’ll call you Skippy.”“Don’t call me that, it sounds disrespectful, monkey.”“You prefer shithead? Because that’s the other option, Skippy-O.” I kept glancing around, fearing the Ruhar would hear me.“Can we compromise on The Great and Powerful Oz?” It asked.“I’m not a flying monkey, so that’s a no, Skippy.”“Unacceptable.”“How about we go for something more formal, like Skippy McSkippster?”“No.”“Skippy Skipperson? Skippy Skippkowski? Skippy Von Skipping? Or maybe Sir Skippy Skippton-Skippersworth?”“No, no, no and NO!”“I can go on like this all day.”“I believe you could.”\"What you got?\" Ski asked.Cornpone winked. \"Uh, let's see. Damn! I got a gen-u-ine smorgasbord of Hooah! bars.\"\"A smorgasbord?\" I asked skeptically. \"Really?\"\"Oh yeah, a smorgasbord at least. Could be a plethora, maybe even, oooh, an honest to God, gosh-darned corn-u-copia of snack foods.\" It was funny to hear Jesse say 'plethora' in his deep southern accent.\"Cut the bullshit, man, you're making me hungry.\" Ski protested. \"What flavors you got in there?\"\"Well, I got Cinnamon Cardboard, of course, also Raisins 'n' Gravel, and, my personal fave, Original Sawdust.\"Crap. I got stuck with Raisin 'n' Gravel. The raisins were harder to chew than the gravel.“Space combat sounds complicated.” I thought back to when I’d listened to the Chicken pilot talk about air combat after our first war game, on Camp Alpha.“Uh huh. Then there’s the Skippy factor.”Part of me wanted to avoid taking the bait. “The Skippy factor?”“You know, my incredible awesomeness.”",

  "bookDescription": "With his new rank, secrets begin to unfold for Van as war and politics become one and the same. The Fafnir is no longer a mere ship—it’s a force to be reckoned with, but it isn’t complete.One possible answer lies in deep space, in a secret facility funded by an array of allies. But this laboratory creates something far more deadly than a virus or a weapon.It produces ships.Null Stellarium is more than a shipyard. It’s a proving ground, steeped with science and engineering designed to push warships faster than ever before, and armed to confront the growing menace of a universe where everything is influenced by a hidden evil.As Van and his crew grow into their new roles, Perry unlocks a memory that reaches into the very beginning of the Tudor family’s service, nearly a century earlier.But sometimes, the truth is hidden for a reason, and Van must decide—How much does he really want to know? And how far can he take his ship, knowing there’s a price on his head?",

  "bookDescription": "WINNER OF THE JAMES HERBERT AWARD FOR HORROR WRITING “The Troop scared the hell out of me, and I couldn’t put it down. This is old-school horror at its best.” —Stephen KingOnce every year, Scoutmaster Tim Riggs leads a troop of boys into the Canadian wilderness for a weekend camping trip—a tradition as comforting and reliable as a good ghost story around a roaring bonfire. But when an unexpected intruder stumbles upon their campsite—shockingly thin, disturbingly pale, and voraciously hungry—Tim and the boys are exposed to something far more frightening than any tale of terror. The human carrier of a bioengineered nightmare. A horror that spreads faster than fear. A harrowing struggle for survival with no escape from the elements, the infected…or one another.  Part Lord of the Flies, part 28 Days Later—and all-consuming—this tightly written, edge-of-your-seat thriller takes you deep into the heart of darkness, where fear feeds on sanity…and terror hungers for more.",

Instead, they find something far worse than death.\nThe colonists aren't dead—they're changed. A new kind of enemy has arrived in Province 921, microscopic invaders that transform humans into perfectly coordinated killing machines. These \"Demon\" parasites don't just control minds, they improve them, creating an army that works with terrifying efficiency.\nAs cities fall and soldiers turn against their own, Centurion James McGill discovers he's mysteriously immune to infection. But immunity comes with a price. To save humanity from becoming pawns of a new Galactic species, McGill must navigate a web of seduction, betrayal, and impossible choices.\nSome invasions come with warships. Others come with a whisper, a touch, and a promise of something better. The question is: what happens when the enemy might be right?\nDEMON WORLD is the latest action-packed entry in B.V. Larson's bestselling Undying Mercenaries series.",
