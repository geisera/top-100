In order to complete his work, he travels to a necron tomb world. In the process, he attracts the attention of something even more dangerous than ancient xenos…READ IT BECAUSEBelisarius Cawl continues to be one of the most important figures in the 41st Millennium as he attempts to solve the greatest problem facing the Imperium – allowing safe passage through the Cicatrix Maledictum. He squares off against ancient necrons and the forces of Chaos in his audacious attempt to do the impossible.THE STORYFor years, Belisarius Cawl has nurtured an audacious plan to stabilise the Attilan Gap sufficiently that the Imperium might open a stable route into Imperium Nihilus. With the primarch Roboute Guilliman having crossed the Great Rift, and now isolated on the far side, time is running out.Before Cawl can perfect his latest great work, he requires one last element: control codes preserved on an ancient necron world trapped on the event horizon of a black hole.

  "bookDescription": "We were fighting on the wrong side, of a war we couldn't win. And that was the good news. The Ruhar hit us on Columbus Day. There we were, innocently drifting along the cosmos on our little blue marble, like the native Americans in 1492. Over the horizon come ships of a technologically advanced, aggressive culture, and BAM! There go the good old days, when humans only got killed by each other. So, Columbus Day. It fits. When the morning sky twinkled again, this time with Kristang starships jumping in to hammer the Ruhar, we thought we were saved. The UN Expeditionary Force hitched a ride on Kristang ships to fight the Ruhar, wherever our new allies thought we could be useful. So, I went from fighting with the US Army in Nigeria, to fighting in space. It was lies, all of it. We shouldn't even be fighting the Ruhar, they aren't our enemy, our allies are. I'd better start at the beginning....A selection of scenes from Columbus Day:There was a faint click, and the other door popped open a quarter inch. Cautiously, I pulled it open and stuck my head in. Beyond the door was a warehouse, maybe fifty feet by thirty, twenty feet tall, filled with racks of what I thought was mostly old, useless, dirty, dusty broken junk. I wandered in cautiously. Why the Ruhar had made the effort to store any of it made no sense to me. Surely there had to be something in there that I could use as a weapon.A man’s voice, with a snarky attitude, rang out behind me. “Excellent! Bipedal, 1300cc brain, opposable thumbs. A hairless monkey. You can carry me out of here.”I spun around in a panic. No one was there. “Who said that?”“Me. Here, I’m the shiny cylinder on the shelf. I unlocked that door.\"“You are? You mean you’re talking to me through a speaker in that thing?”“No, I am that thing. I am what you monkeys call an artificial intelligence.”I cocked my head and examined it skeptically. “You look like a chrome-plated beer can.\" That was a completely accurate description. The cylinder even tapered slightly at the top, and was ringed by a ridge. \"You’re really an AI?\"\"Yup. You should refer to me as The Lord God Almighty.”“That position is already filled. I think I’ll call you Skippy.”“Don’t call me that, it sounds disrespectful, monkey.”“You prefer shithead? Because that’s the other option, Skippy-O.” I kept glancing around, fearing the Ruhar would hear me.“Can we compromise on The Great and Powerful Oz?” It asked.“I’m not a flying monkey, so that’s a no, Skippy.”“Unacceptable.”“How about we go for something more formal, like Skippy McSkippster?”“No.”“Skippy Skipperson? Skippy Skippkowski? Skippy Von Skipping? Or maybe Sir Skippy Skippton-Skippersworth?”“No, no, no and NO!”“I can go on like this all day.”“I believe you could.”\"What you got?\" Ski asked.Cornpone winked. \"Uh, let's see. Damn! I got a gen-u-ine smorgasbord of Hooah! bars.\"\"A smorgasbord?\" I asked skeptically. \"Really?\"\"Oh yeah, a smorgasbord at least. Could be a plethora, maybe even, oooh, an honest to God, gosh-darned corn-u-copia of snack foods.\" It was funny to hear Jesse say 'plethora' in his deep southern accent.\"Cut the bullshit, man, you're making me hungry.\" Ski protested. \"What flavors you got in there?\"\"Well, I got Cinnamon Cardboard, of course, also Raisins 'n' Gravel, and, my personal fave, Original Sawdust.\"Crap. I got stuck with Raisin 'n' Gravel. The raisins were harder to chew than the gravel.“Space combat sounds complicated.” I thought back to when I’d listened to the Chicken pilot talk about air combat after our first war game, on Camp Alpha.“Uh huh. Then there’s the Skippy factor.”Part of me wanted to avoid taking the bait. “The Skippy factor?”“You know, my incredible awesomeness.”",

  "bookDescription": "GIVE ME BACK MY LEGIONS!\nIn September of the year 9 A.D. three Roman legions are trapped in the Teutoburg Forest by tens of thousands of rebelling Germanic tribesmen under the Romano-German renegade, Arminius. In an attempt to save what can be saved, an alien starship transports one of those legions, Legio XIIX, to safety. But the aliens are rushed by events and transport the XIIXth not just in space, but through time as well.\nDropped four centuries into their future, under the leadership of their first spear centurion, Marcus Caelius and the young but promising junior tribune, Gaius Pompeius, Legio XIIX must fight to survive almost from the first moments of arrival. Moreover, they must march and fight across a continent to find their way home.\nBecause home, the Roman Empire, needs them—their discipline, their tactics, their indomitable fortitude—more desperately than it has ever needed anything . . . because New Years Eve, 406 A.D. is coming, and with it, a horde of barbarians are going to cross the frozen Rhine and, unless stopped cold, destroy the Empire.\nAt the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).\nPraise for Tom Kratman:“The author’s flair for fight scenes is undeniable.” —Publishers Weekly\n“Tom Kratman's Dirty Water is a time-travel journey to Boston, where a gate that grants wishes brings fresh Christmas angst to the efforts of aliens, witches, a special toy store, and a grandfather's interest in exploring bygone Boston with his granddaughters. Time travel is vividly rendered and immersive in this gritty adventure, which links disparate figures and interests for a delightfully unpredictable romp. Both books are highly recommended for discriminating sci-fi collections.” —Midwest Book Review\nIn 1974, at age seventeen, Tom Kratman became a political refugee and defector from the PRM (People’s Republic of Massachusetts) by virtue of joining the Regular Army. He stayed a Regular Army infantryman most of his adult life, returning to Massachusetts as an unofficial dissident while attending Boston College after his first hitch. Back in the Army, he managed to do just about everything there was to do at one time or another. After the Gulf War, with the bottom dropping completely out of the anti-communist market, Tom decided to become a lawyer. Every now and again, when the frustrations of legal life and having to deal with other lawyers got to be too much, Tom would rejoin the Army (or a somewhat similar group, say) for fun and frolic in other climes. His family, muttering darkly, put up with this for years. He no longer practices law, instead writing full-time for Baen. His novels for Baen include A State of Disobedience, Caliphate, and the series consisting of A Desert Called Peace, Carnifex, The Lotus Eaters, The Amazon Legion, Come and Take Them, The Rods and the Axe, and A Pillar of Fire by Night. With John Ringo, he has written the novels Watch on the Rhine, Yellow Eyes, and The Tuloriad. Also for Baen, he has written the first three volumes of the modern-day military fiction series Countdown. He's recently co-authored the brilliant The Romanov Reign Series with Kacey Ezell and Justin Watson.",

A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.THE ENDER UNIVERSEEnder seriesEnder’s Game / Ender in Exile / Speaker for the Dead / Xenocide / Children of the MindEnder’s Shadow seriesEnder’s Shadow / Shadow of the Hegemon / Shadow Puppets / Shadow of the Giant / Shadows in FlightChildren of the FleetThe First Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)Earth Unaware / Earth Afire / Earth AwakensThe Second Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)The Swarm /The HiveEnder novellasA War of Gifts /First MeetingsAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

For every ship that leaves earth orbit, twenty arrive, and some have ill intent.Then, things get interesting.The Six Stars League is coming apart at the seams, and their actions require justice. When Van and the Fist intervene, they aren't alone—the GKU is there to lend a hand, and they arrive in new, lethal ships totally unknown to the Fist.With their secret navy, the GKU begins a competition for control of humanity among the stars—and seizure of the ultimate prize.Destroying the Stillness.For this job, Van will need bigger guns, a bigger ship, and more resolve. That means the Fafnir will be offline for a while, and other ships will have to step up. Enter Icky and Netty and the Fafnir Faithful, who decide that if one ship is good, then six ships is better.On the offensive, the Fist reaches across the stars to the distant Pleaides, deep in the big black where Stillness agents have reigned terror since Mark Tudor began his career.

  "bookDescription": "The Berserkers forged him into a weapon. They’ve regretted it ever since.\nWhen Jack Ames fled the choking sprawl of his dystopian homeworld, he never meant to crash-land in the Berserker Corps—the galaxy’s deadliest mercenary outfit. But he found a new home. Strapped into a 135-ton gravtank or leading a power-suited grunt platoon, Ames is a tactical savant and a fearless warrior, turning battlefields into his personal canvas of chaos. Off-duty, his benders and bedroom conquests are stuff of Corps legend, rivaled only by the cataclysmic hangovers the morning after.\nTrouble is Ames sucks at blind obedience. Clueless officers, light-years from the shrapnel storm, bark orders that bleed good soldiers dry fast. So he shreds the playbook, launching audacious, seat-of-the-pants maneuvers that snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. His troopers hail him as a hero; the top brass brands him a cancer, stripping rank, slamming cell doors, and shuffling him through endless reassignments in a haze of court martials and office hours. Through it all, Ames grapples with the mirror: gifted soldier or architect of his own ruin?\nThe Berserkers want him gone. But Ames fights dirty—on the field and off. Love him or loathe him, demote him or decorate him; he’ll get the job done or die trying.\nOrders be damned!\nFrom USA Today Bestseller Ryan W. Aslesen comes a blistering military sci‑fi novel that plunges readers into the chaos of futuristic warfare, where defiance can be as deadly as the enemy’s guns.\nPart of the critically acclaimed Berserkers series, Orders Be Damned is a riveting standalone novel set in the gritty War’s Edge universe. Each book in the series is written so readers can dive into the action at any point. If you’re a fan of Hammer’s Slammers, Old Man’s War, or Starship Troopers, this is the book for you.\nWarning: This book is intended for a mature audience. Reader discretion is advised.",

  "bookDescription": "Book 1 in the Scouring SeriesAs the Siege of Terra ends, there are many loose ends – Traitors trying desperately to escape, a monumental vacuum of power to fill, and a crumbling galactic government to see to. Those who hold on to power must decide how to wield it, and a new structure must be put in place, all while desires to exact vengeance run high.READ IT BECAUSEIt's the beginning of an epic series. Find out what happens after the cataclysmic events of the Horus Heresy, as an unsteady Imperium must find its footing and learn how to exist without the guidance of the Emperor.THE STORYHorus is dead. Terra lies in ruins. The Emperor is silent. Amid the rubble of the Palace, shell-shocked survivors emerge into the light of an uncertain dawn. New powers are present now, ones that have travelled the length of the galaxy to bring salvation to the Imperium, though they are as readily cast as usurpers as redeemers. The survivors of the Traitors’ Grand Armada, now scattered and desperate to escape vengeance, are riven with doubt and dissension, and their gods too are silent. Amid all the grief and confusion, some hopeful souls believe the war to be over and an era of renewal just ahead. But wiser heads know that this war can never end, and that the only question remaining is who shall rise to power within the perilous new age, and who shall fall.Written by Chris Wraight.",

  "bookDescription": "When Thomas heard the cries for help, he didn’t hesitate to do the right thing. It was his chance for redemption.\nUntil everything went wrong.\nThe cave should have been deserted. The perfect place to hide. Instead, it’s crawling with soldiers and engineers working to unearth the impossible:\nExcalibur.\nDeep beneath the mountain, she’s waited centuries to be found. Not a sword in the stone, but a starship. And according to the onboard AI, Thomas is the only one who can command her.\nNow he's on the run across a galaxy more astonishing and treacherous than he ever imagined, where magic and technology intertwine and ancient powers lurk in the shadows. Relentlessly hunted and hopelessly lost, he needs to learn fast if he wants to survive. Only his greatest challenge isn't training to pilot a starship. It's accepting that he, of all people, is responsible for reigniting the hope of a fallen kingdom.\nKing Arthur’s legend may be complete, but his is just beginning…",

Even more puzzling, the ship is of human construction. As the ship regains functionality, traps left by mutineers threaten the lives of Archer and the tiny crew aboard the derelict.When he succeeds in bringing Defender back to Alliance space, an idealistic scientist posts critical information regarding Defender’s advanced technology. The Nemeans and Scyllans press for peace talks—a delaying tactic while they evaluate the information dump. When they learn that implementation is at least a year away, they break the truce violently, attempting to capture the Alliance and EU delegates during peace talks on Earth.Archer suffers devastating losses in the attack, which he has difficulty processing emotionally. Bette has her own issues of this type, and the two part on uncertain terms. She then disappears, leaving a cryptic note.Defender’s Awakening is a pulse-pounding space opera of interstellar intrigue, moral dilemmas, and fragile emotional bonds. It’s perfect for fans of epic sci-fi adventures, where heroes must not only battle their foes but also control their hearts.Book 4 of a new military science fiction series from award-winning author John J.

After extensive reverse engineering, Galactic Planetary Resources develops technology that propels humanity to expand rapidly beyond Earth over the next sixty years. These advancements ultimately lead to another astonishing discovery: a transit gate hidden in Earth’s solar system for thousands of years—and now, it can be used.\nA cast of engaging, well-developed characters aboard the corporate starship Audacious discover more than they ever dreamed possible, including the revelation that this isn’t the first time humanity has ventured into the stars.\nA team of United Earth Hegemony Marines, led by Staff Sergeant Dixon, is requisitioned to assist Captain Rohit Mishra, scientist Irina Orlova, and others as they push the boundaries of what humanity can achieve—while trying to convince Earth’s government to let them do it.\nNarrated in first person by CAIPARR, the sentient artificial intelligence owned by GPR, the novel explores the ethics of artificial intelligence, humanity’s existential beliefs, and the age-old question: should we do something, simply because we can?",

  "bookDescription": "First came the malfunctions. Then came the war.\nSelene thought repairing a derelict station would be her biggest challenge. That was before the turrets started firing. Before the hull breaches. Before the mercenary blockade arrived to claim what she'd found.\nBlack Sky fights dirty. Corridors seal during firefights. Life support fails mid-battle. Ancient weapon systems activate with targeting parameters centuries out of date. Every deck holds new dangers, new systems coming online, new ways to die.\nThe mercenaries keep coming. Boarding pods slam into the hull. Infiltration teams sabotage critical systems. Their leader promises to tear the station apart piece by piece until he gets what he wants.\nSelene's crew fights back with whatever works. Jury-rigged turrets. Reactivated war drones. Corridors flooded with toxins. The station provides weapons, though using them might trigger something worse. Each battle awakens more systems. Each system remembers its purpose.\nThe fights grow deadlier. The station grows hungrier. Something massive stirs in Black Sky's depths, and both sides race to control it.\nWill Selene unlock the ultimate weapon that saves her crew and defeats the invaders? Or will she unleash something that makes the mercenaries look like the lesser evil?",

It is regarded as one of the greatest military science fiction novels ever written, capturing the alienation that servicemen and women experience even now upon returning home from battle. This book shines a light not only on the culture of the 1970s in which it was written, but also on our potential future. \"To say that The Forever War is the best science fiction war novel ever written is to damn it with faint praise. It is…as fine and woundingly genuine a war story as any I've read\" (William Gibson). This ebook features an illustrated biography of Joe Haldeman including rare images from the author's personal collection",

  "bookDescription": "After a decade, acclaimed science fiction master John Scalzi returns to the galaxy of the Old Man's War series with the long awaited seventh book, The Shattering PeaceTHE PEACE IS SHATTERINGFor a decade, peace has reigned in interstellar space. A tripartite agreement between the Colonial Union, the Earth, and the alien Conclave has kept the forces of war at bay, even when some would have preferred to return to the fighting and struggle of former times. For now, more sensible heads have prevailed – and have even championed unity.But now, there is a new force that threatens the hard-maintained peace: The Consu, the most advanced intelligent species humans have ever met, are on the cusp of a species-defining civil war. This war is between Consu factions... but nothing the Consu ever do is just about them. The Colonial Union, the Earth and the Conclave have been unwillingly dragged into the conflict, in the most surprising of ways.Gretchen Trujillo is a mid-level diplomat, working in an unimportant part of the Colonial Union bureaucracy. But when she is called to take part in a secret mission involving representatives from every powerful faction in space, what she finds there has the chance to redefine the destinies of humans and aliens alike... or destroy them forever.OTHER TOR BOOKS BY JOHN SCALZIAgent to the StarsThe Android’s DreamFuzzy NationRedshirtsYour Hate Mail Will Be Graded:A Decade of Whatever, 1998–2008The Kaiju Preservation SocietyStarter VillainWhen the Moon Hits Your EyeTHE OLD MAN’S WAR NOVELSOld Man’s WarThe Ghost BrigadesThe Last ColonyZoë’s TaleThe Human DivisionThe End of All ThingsTHE LOCK IN SERIESLock InHead OnUnlockedTHE INTERDEPENDENCY SEQUENCEThe Collapsing EmpireThe Consuming FireThe Last EmperoxEDITED BY JOHN SCALZIMetatropolisAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

These \"Demon\" parasites don't just control minds, they improve them, creating an army that works with terrifying efficiency.\nAs cities fall and soldiers turn against their own, Centurion James McGill discovers he's mysteriously immune to infection. But immunity comes with a price. To save humanity from becoming pawns of a new Galactic species, McGill must navigate a web of seduction, betrayal, and impossible choices.\nSome invasions come with warships. Others come with a whisper, a touch, and a promise of something better. The question is: what happens when the enemy might be right?\nDEMON WORLD is the latest action-packed entry in B.V. Larson's bestselling Undying Mercenaries series.",

  "bookDescription": "It is difficult enough to fight the powerful enemy you know. When you have enemies on your own side, it can be deadly.\nThe war between the Inter-Planetary Commonwealth has heated up. Similarly, Halberd’s romance with the intelligent and beautiful Amy Davidson has begun to blaze. At the same time, Halberd finds he is no safer on the ground than he is in command of his ship.\nTechnological developments may have given the Royal Navy an edge. It is up to Halberd to lead a small force to test them in action. His group of three ships enters Rodinan territory, only to find the enemy ready and waiting. With no option to retreat, Halberd must lead the ships deeper into enemy space before they can find a way home.\nWherever Halberd goes, he finds himself In Harm’s Way.",

  "bookDescription": "The wrong crew. The wrong ship. The right Captain.Idealistic navy lieutenant Jacob Grimm just wanted to honor his mother’s sacrifice in the last great war. When he’s forced to return fire and destroy a squadron of ships to save his own, he thinks he’s the hero…Until they discover the ships are full of children.Disgraced and denied promotion, Jacob’s career is over. That is until the head of ONI needs a disposable officer to command a battered destroyer on the rim.There’s just one problem, Interceptor hasn’t had a CO in months and the ship is a mess. Worse, the system he’s assigned to is corrupt and on the verge of all-out civil war with the Alliance.However, no one told Jacob he was disposable.Pirates, smugglers, and Caliphate spies complicate the situation and one captain with an old ship can’t enforce the law, let alone stop anyone.The single greatest discovery of all time is about to change intergalactic politics forever. If Jacob doesn’t find a way to succeed, then it won’t just be the end of the Alliance, it will be the end of freedom for humanity. From USA Today bestselling author Jeffery H.

Many of them deep and dark, with implications that reach back to the time when he himself walked the Earth on two legs.In some ways, humanity has become more alien than the extraterrestrials. And if Henry can't figure out what this means - fast - he's going to have serious problems keeping himself and his crew safe.Download I, Starship: The Earth We Knew and grab the edge of your seat for this bold new space opera.",

A war like no other.\nWhen the research starship Galileo vanishes without a trace, the powers-that-be are quick to bury the incident, eager to prevent escalating tensions that could lead to war. As a former POW, Soren refuses to give the ship up for lost.\nHis daughter is one of the missing.\nTaking matters into his own hands, Soren starts pulling strings and calling in favors, determined to launch a clandestine mission to bring Galileo home. When an old friend offers him a ship for the operation, he expects a rusty relic headed for the scrapyard.\nInstead, he's given the Wraith—an unfinished, experimental starship with plenty of potential and just as many problems. A marvel of engineering…if his crew can keep her running.\nThey’d better.\nBecause Galileo’s disappearance is just the beginning. War is coming to the Federation from the most unlikely of places.\nAnd Soren may be the only one who can stop it.",

  "bookDescription": "On a distant Earth colony, an orphaned survivor of an alien invasion discovers that the greatest world-ending dangers aren’t behind her.\nIt’s been eight years since an alien invasion drove a small surviving group of settlers to seek refuge in an underground shelter. Cut off from the rest of humanity, the ragtag band has maintained a narrowly functioning colony due to communal effort and salvage runs. Alex Archer has her own duties as a dog handler. While this off-world colony may be harsh, Ash, Alex’s black shepherd raised to sense threats, makes living in it a little nicer.\nBut the tenuous hide-and-seek with the monstrous species known as the Lankies is about to come to an end for Alex and her close-knit crew of soldiers, techs, and friends. When a salvage operation goes catastrophically wrong, the Lankies home in on the humans.\nWith hopes of a rescue long faded, all Alex has left is will—and the fear that there’s so much more to lose.",

In fact, it's just begun, and Van knows that every decision he's made for the past decade will come to bear on who lives, and who dies—And who is meant to rule over a universe where freedom and justice are the ultimate pursuit. At any cost, Van and his crew will finish the job, but they're going to need a lot of help from people and beings who have been observers.Until now.The time for watching is over. The time for victory is now. But the cost might be more than anyone can pay, and Van is no longer merely an agent of justice. He's a father, a husband, and a friend—and he's going to need every connection in the stars to defeat the ultimate enemy and save his people.",

  "bookDescription": "From the author of the amazon best selling Empire Rising series comes a new epic saga.For over two millennia, humanity has lived under the unyielding peace of the Human Republic. Born from the ashes of a devastating revolt, the Republic vowed to prevent the nuclear holocaust of another interstellar war at any cost. Its inner core worlds—thirteen powerful colonies—maintain an iron grip over the thousands of outlying planets humanity has settled.But peace has come at a price.Two and a half thousand years of centralized rule, greed, and corruption have all but enslaved those who live outside the Republic’s inner core. For the citizens of these rim worlds, freedom is a distant dream—a relic buried in humanity’s past.Yet what has been buried cannot be hidden forever.For those who strive for these long lost ideals, they will soon discover what so many before them have learnt the hard way – freedom always comes at a cost.For Second Lieutenant Caleb Hawthorne, the cost will be higher than he can imagine. When a secessionist movement arises, Caleb must choose between the navy he has dedicated his life to and his loyalty to family and homeworld. As the tyranny of his masters becomes clearer, there is only one choice. But can he learn the ways of war fast enough to make a difference? And can he throw off the ties that bind him to the Republic so easily?Freedom, family, and love are powerful rallying cries, but can they inspire a people to accomplish what no one has done in nearly three thousand years— to forge a nation of their own?Embers of Rebellion is the first novel in the Secession Wars series by D. J. Holmes that will tell the sweeping story of the Rim's quest for freedom from the Republic and all the war, loss, and devestation that will arise from a peoples' striving to be free.",

  "bookDescription": "Master Sergeant Gant Maker was a highly-decorated and well-respected Marine - until his last mission left him as the sole survivor of an encounter with a vicious race called the Vacra. Served up as a scapegoat and drummed out of the military, he has since lived a life of seclusion with only an adopted alien as a companion.Now the Vacra have returned. As the only person to have ever faced them and survived, Maker is reinstated in the Corps and given the onerous task of finding this enemy on a world located at the edge of known space. Assisting him is an unlikely band of military rejects, including a blind sharpshooter, an unstable psychic, and a genetically-engineered killing machine who refuses to fight.Given that the Vacra have superior weapons and technology, Maker recognizes that his team is at a distinct disadvantage. But Marines are nothing if not resourceful, and Maker has an audacious plan that just may level the playing field – if it doesn’t get them all killed.",

Though it’s not a heavy-hitting battlegroup, the light carriers and support vessels sailing through the wormhole are sufficient firepower to handle what’s left of the terrorists.\nBut overconfidence is their undoing.\nLeague-made heavy battle cruisers strike without warning and decimate the new arrivals, obliterating an unarmed hospital ship in the surprise attack. Arthur isn’t the only one who sees red as horrific losses pile up, the enemy seeming to anticipate their every FTL jump. With President Robbins refusing to send overwhelming force to end the conflict quickly, desperation drives Arthur to use any means necessary to gain intel from their war captive.\nAnd threats of mutiny once again gain steam.\nIntelligence collected under duress proves ineffective, while looming court martial brings Arthur to the breaking point. But it will take more than a crisis of conscience to see the conflict through to the bitter end against a dominating force.\nIt will take an iron will.",

  "bookDescription": "WINNER OF THE JAMES HERBERT AWARD FOR HORROR WRITING “The Troop scared the hell out of me, and I couldn’t put it down. This is old-school horror at its best.” —Stephen KingOnce every year, Scoutmaster Tim Riggs leads a troop of boys into the Canadian wilderness for a weekend camping trip—a tradition as comforting and reliable as a good ghost story around a roaring bonfire. But when an unexpected intruder stumbles upon their campsite—shockingly thin, disturbingly pale, and voraciously hungry—Tim and the boys are exposed to something far more frightening than any tale of terror. The human carrier of a bioengineered nightmare. A horror that spreads faster than fear. A harrowing struggle for survival with no escape from the elements, the infected…or one another.  Part Lord of the Flies, part 28 Days Later—and all-consuming—this tightly written, edge-of-your-seat thriller takes you deep into the heart of darkness, where fear feeds on sanity…and terror hungers for more.",

Who will lead the charge for justice—will it be Van and his trusted friends, or will the former GKU demand a seat at the table in a universe where nothing is ever settled, and old grudges don't die—they just linger?But old problems require new solutions, and Van sees the need for soldiers as an opportunity.

Platoon sergeant Andrew Grayson must crash-course train new volunteers—all while dulling his searing memories of battle with alcohol and meds.\nKnowing Earth’s uneasy respite won’t last, the North American Commonwealth and its Sino-Russian allies hurtle toward two dangerous options: hit the Lanky forces on Mars or go after deserters who stole a fleet of invaluable warships critical to winning the war.
