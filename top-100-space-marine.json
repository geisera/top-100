Keep thinks it's a run of bad luck. Ben isn't so sure.\nBefore long, Ben's chasing saboteurs who shouldn't exist, investigating crimes that make no sense, and trying to stop a war between the Empire and the Outer Rim. Oh, and Emerald keeps insisting they're married.\nThe clock is ticking as Ben and his crew race to figure out who's responsible for the madness before businesses collapse, people die, and Emerald actually makes Ben go to couple's therapy. But when every lead points in a different direction and even his allies can't be trusted, Ben's going to learn that the deck has been stacked from the beginning.\nGood thing he's always been a wild card.",

    "bookDescription": "Book 1 in the Scouring SeriesAs the Siege of Terra ends, there are many loose ends – Traitors trying desperately to escape, a monumental vacuum of power to fill, and a crumbling galactic government to see to. Those who hold on to power must decide how to wield it, and a new structure must be put in place, all while desires to exact vengeance run high.READ IT BECAUSEIt's the beginning of an epic series. Find out what happens after the cataclysmic events of the Horus Heresy, as an unsteady Imperium must find its footing and learn how to exist without the guidance of the Emperor.THE STORYHorus is dead. Terra lies in ruins. The Emperor is silent. Amid the rubble of the Palace, shell-shocked survivors emerge into the light of an uncertain dawn. New powers are present now, ones that have travelled the length of the galaxy to bring salvation to the Imperium, though they are as readily cast as usurpers as redeemers. The survivors of the Traitors’ Grand Armada, now scattered and desperate to escape vengeance, are riven with doubt and dissension, and their gods too are silent. Amid all the grief and confusion, some hopeful souls believe the war to be over and an era of renewal just ahead. But wiser heads know that this war can never end, and that the only question remaining is who shall rise to power within the perilous new age, and who shall fall.Written by Chris Wraight.",

        "reviewTitle": "A deeply mixed bag with more bad than good...*SPOILERS*",
        "reviewDescription": "*SPOILER WARNING*First off, do not be fooled by the cover art. The book does feature a council of the Primarchs, and the High Lords of Terra, but it is astonishingly brief and does nothing but degrade the sensibilities of beloved characters. It would seem, to my mind, beyond certain that the loyalist sons would have the good sense - after a ruinous war of Heresy caused by their once-brother - not to argue and snipe with one another in front of the rest of the Imperial leaders when the dust had barely settled and the blood not yet dried. This is overestimating them, apparently.Despite neither the Siege of Terra V3 and Era of Ruin not featuring it - and it being arguably an incredibly important piece of lore for the reader to see and understand - AotI does not include a solo meeting/reunion of the Primarchs in the immediate aftermath of Horus' defeat. Nor does it feature any Primarch POV chapters. We do not get to see them collectively grieve, nor resolutely unite, after their Lord Father's gruesome downfall. This is a big misstep, in my opinion.On top of the omissions, the staggering bloat in this book, and sheer pointlessness of some of the subplots (I can't fathom why they included a Chaos Cultist's pointless flight across barren Terran plains in lieu of a Blood Angels POV about their fallen Lord), is matched only by the baffling fixation on minutia. There are parts of it that are about as thrilling to read as a cargo manifesto. Did any of the Black Library authors think that's what people who have stuck with the franchise for decades wanted to read about in such a rich and storied setting? This series is arguably more interesting than the Siege was, and yet they waste so much of its potential.Speaking of omissions; there are no Abaddon chapters, nothing whatsoever featuring Corax (bar a brief reference to his seat at the council being empty), nothing whatsoever about the White Scars except a brief appearance by their Primarch, nothing concerning Valdor that isn't just a passing comment, and nothing of note happens in respect of the Mechanicus/Mechanicum (no POV chapters). Worst of all, in my view, we don't get to read the perspective of any of the Ultramarines as they first landed on Terra to help lift the siege.All that being said; this book was clearly written with purpose. It is abundantly clear that Wraight has created a through-line between The Scouring and the current 40K timeline in that Guilliman is, for baffling reasons that might be why they've delayed his union with El'Jonson for so long, being set up as an Empire-stealing maniac whose actions might spark a civil war.It also seems, in my view at least, to have been purposely crafted with just enough hints and bread-crumbs about larger in-universe implications to get LoreTubers churning out endless content about it over one single line of text.With those considerations in mind; it is a well-written book, and it does move the 30K timeline forward slightly. It is just, perhaps, one only for the purist collectors and setting enthusiasts. In my opinion, it does not provide enough substance to justify the price.Bought on Kindle.",

Despite bringing peace to many of the stars, the war has turned—and come home, bringing with it a new kind fight that Van knows all to well.Politics.With that brawl comes money, and with money, the fight gets serious. Retta's network reveals a threat rising in Europe, as various nations struggle to break free of earth, make bonds among the stars, and find new and exciting ways to turn the planet into something to be packaged and sold.For a profit, of course.Earth isn't the only world in danger, and a mystery in deepest space brings a strange connection to Perry's past—one that will unlock a second front on Van's war, all while opening the crew up to danger rooted in the halls of Anvil Dark.Anvil Dark, and the GKU aren't allies, not really, and Van is faced with old enemies and new recruits in a dirty fight for control of something that should belong to everyone—the law. Using technocrats, criminals, and opportunists, Van's enemies have bought their way into an alliance that will push the Fafnir and her crew into a battle for the ultimate control of earth's future——And the defense of earth will be waged as Van keeps one eye on deepest space, where an ancient enemy has awakened, eager for vengeance. Eager for the end of all life.And eager to end the Tudor line, once and for all.",

Chaney has a habit of doing that.After a couple of false starts with this story arc, which began with the orginal crew's adult kids being shoved to the forefront (not very interesting), things are back on track here.  Thankfully, Van, Torina, Perry,  Icky, Funboy and freinds are (mostly)  in charge for this big finale.  Which involves bad guys from the earliest books of the series.  Still, it is clear the series will continue, since there is a setup for new story arc at the very end.",

His breakthrough changed everything: a partnership between human creativity and AI processing that makes him unstoppable in combat.\nIt also made him the most hunted man in the solar system.\nThe attacks come from everywhere.

They want to become him. Someone is building an army based on his blueprint, turning his revolutionary partnership into a tool for mass control.\nSeven lives hang in a cosmic storm. One impossible rescue. Zero room for error.\nThe choice that saves them might doom everyone else.\nHow far will David go to protect his creation from becoming humanity's greatest threat? Will his decision save the galaxy or unleash something that should never exist?\nDive into this adrenaline-fueled military thriller where innovation becomes the ultimate weapon.",

Seemey has evolved from a pompous ass to a proper starship captain who willingly accepts and depends on Henry for survival of the UES Interchange.  As they struggle to unite the various surviving factions, a new and infinitely more dangerous foe approaches.  I read this book over the weekend, and couldn't put it down!  This is the perfect setup for the next book.  I know this book (6) just came out, but I'm so excited to read book 7, I'm starting to vibrate.

        "reviewDescription": "An excellent continuation to this saga. Scott has come up with some amazingly complex and fascinating alien cultures that Seemey and Morgan encounter as their mission continues. One race in particular gets focus as the story unfolds, and Scott's imagination shines as he portrays this race of beings. This mission takes place in a new star system, and the crew run into the Cats and Coalition again upon coming out of offset. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and definitely recommend it!",

Yet somehow they might try.Until they no longer do.That is exactly what happened when the UES Interchange limped to a union of five different alien races in order to get assistance to get the Interchange repaired and upgraded. Sergeant Henry Morgan and Captain Seemey certainly are in again for some nasty surprises.And this universe gets about to enter an unexpected war threatening to destroy everything.Enjoy",

To win, Star Watch must relearn maneuver warfare across light-years against super soldiers bred for war.Lord High Admiral Haig commands the fleet—but Captain Maddox has the plan that might save them all, if he can make anyone listen. Politics, assassins, and Directive 87 threaten to shatter Star Watch just when humanity needs unity most.THE LOST BATTLESHIP is the 24th book in the Lost Starship series, a star-spanning saga of deadly space war by millions-selling author Vaughn Heppner.",

    "bookDescription": "Master Sergeant Gant Maker was a highly-decorated and well-respected Marine - until his last mission left him as the sole survivor of an encounter with a vicious race called the Vacra. Served up as a scapegoat and drummed out of the military, he has since lived a life of seclusion with only an adopted alien as a companion.Now the Vacra have returned. As the only person to have ever faced them and survived, Maker is reinstated in the Corps and given the onerous task of finding this enemy on a world located at the edge of known space. Assisting him is an unlikely band of military rejects, including a blind sharpshooter, an unstable psychic, and a genetically-engineered killing machine who refuses to fight.Given that the Vacra have superior weapons and technology, Maker recognizes that his team is at a distinct disadvantage. But Marines are nothing if not resourceful, and Maker has an audacious plan that just may level the playing field – if it doesn’t get them all killed.",

I don't restrict my reading to any particular genre. Instead, I'm a sucker for anything with memorable characters & a story that keeps me on the edge of my seat until the end. Reminiscent of Michael Anderle & Sarah Noffke’s Ghost Squadron series and Isaac Hooke’s Forever Gate series. Narrator Mikael Naramore’s talented narration added greatly to the book’s enjoyment. I was given an Audible copy of this book & am voluntarily reviewing it. Since I own both the Kindle & Audible edition I was able to follow along while being read to. I have to admit there were times I sped up the book because I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Different than his Kid Sensation series I’ll be reading more from this author & look forward to the rest of the series! (RIP Marley January 20, 2014 - July 24, 2018).",

        "reviewDescription": "This story is very much character centric and the characters are great. The main character Gant Maker is everything a good marine should be. The crew he gathers around him are all fab characters in their own right. There is plenty of action but we are not awash in details about armour and weapons, or explanations about how the tech works, which can get tedious. It’s just a good shoot ‘em up, blow ‘em up yarn. There is plenty of spacefaring aliens and humanities own ‘hub’ of planets. Again not bogged down in detail of how we got there. Just this is where we are not let’s have an adventure. I am looking forward to the next book.",

The storyline was a winner from the start of the book, I loved Gants character and his Alien buddy, who was a mystery to start with,but you soon came to realize they rely on each other. Can't wait to read the next in the series, and a freebie to boot. Fab",

        "reviewDescription": "\"The Scattering Stars\", book 5 in the space opera series \"I, Starship\" by Scott Bartlett took me by surprise. The series so far is fast paced, full of battles, deceit, edge of your seat writing. I expected book 5 to continue on the same way. My reviews are usually long (check out the previous ones!). So, in order to not write about spoilers, I'll do a quick summary. Something changed, the tone was different. Yes, the characters were the same, and Scott Bartlett definitely followed his previous books. But I experienced an emotion I never had before. I cried. Anything beyond this description I think of being a spoiler. But this book, I feel, is the best so far in this series. Don't take my word for it. We all interpret books we read differently. Read it for yourself and I guarantee you will be waiting for book 6. It's just that good.",

        "reviewDescription": "I've been a fan of the \"I, Starship\" series since it came out, and honest to god I squee with anticipation when a new book drops!  For those of you who don't know, this is book 5 in Scott Bartlett's \"I, Starship\" series, which is a different kind of space opera.  The series overall explore themes like artificial intelligence, slavery, and societal changes over time (which is brilliantly shown to the readers as they travel at relativistic speeds into the future of humanity with the crew of one interstellar ship).  For those of you familiar with the series, you WILL NOT believe the revelations that come out in this installment!  I honestly couldn't put it down and finished it in about 5 hours, but I know I'll be going back to read the entire series again!",

After decades of model-trained AIs wreaking havoc across the globe, humanity is ready to try something a little more…human.Henry is perfect. For one thing, as a reconstituted intelligence, he has no rights and can be forced to do the bidding of the powers that be. For another, he’s the only Heritage Mind™ with any military experience that survived the Great Power Surge of 2072.So, Henry’s it.Blastoff, good Henry! Our hopes and dreams go with you. Oh, and while you’re at it, could you take a look at the aliens setting up shop in our asteroid belt? They seem to be…multiplying.Download I, Starship now and grab the edge of your seat for this bold new space opera.",

Now imagine that your consciousness controls your new body - a state-of-the-art starship - what would you do now? What a great premise for a story. \"I, Starship\" is a story of just such a transfer of consciousness. Now image that your normal bodily functions like breathing, seeing, hearing, etc. are functions of the ship - air circulation systems, cameras throughout the ship (internal and external) that give you sight, microphones to allow you to hear everything that goes on in the ship, etc.  In addition, you control ship movement, both direction and speed. Oh, and not to forget the ships armament for protection from anything else you run into. What a super concept. Great story, great characters, and very interesting situations out in deep space. This is a wonderful read - go get this book.",

        "reviewDescription": "Henry is a human who gets taken out by a flying lawnmower. He wakes up about 100 years in the future not knowing where he is or what has happened to him. It turns out that scientists uploaded Henry's mind to a computer file—including all his emotions and memories. So when Henry is awakened, he is shocked to find out he is essentially an AI overseeing operations on a Military ship in route to our nearest neighboring star. Not everyone understands Henry. The captain thinks he is nothing more than software to be used when needed—and he rarely sees the need for Henry. After a rocky start, Henry finds himself with many of his permissions on board ship denied and basically allowed only to monitor the outside sensors. On top of all this, Henry has his own guardian AI. This program, called GARY for short, has a very narrow view of what Henry is allowed to do during the long years the crew is asleep. If Henry asks the wrong question, it can cause Gary to start a routine to wake up the captain which is the last thing Henry wants.This book is a hoot to read. Henry gets into all sorts of trouble as he tries his best to keep the crew safe and see that their ship gets to its destination without incident. There is a serious side to the story too. Aliens have taken up residence in the Kuiper belt and are building some kind of structure for want of a better term. The crew must investigate this site before they can head for the stars. As the crew heads for the Kuiper belt things do not go as planned. If memory serves, this is when Henry tries to offer unsolicited advice and is sanctioned by the captain—permissions begin to be taken away. Henry is shocked by the captain's attitude toward him but can do nothing about it but live within the guidelines the captain sets.I thoroughly enjoyed this story and am looking forward to book 2. I was surprised when Scott came out with this story as I know he has a couple of others in the works. He's really working hard to give us fans excellent SciFi to read. Thanks Scott!!!",

        "reviewDescription": "Although one can't say it's unique, I've rarely seen a story that considers using a reconstituted human that was originally alive. Although the concept is refreshing, a think the delivery is stereo typical.  The captain is unreasonable in his criticism, and is reluctant to learn from his errors. I would expect a sterling crew such as makes up the interchange to be more polished in their conduct.  It isn't their banter, as its the lack of any cohesion when performing their tactics such as breaking and running rather than a coordinated withdrawal.  Even the idea of a battle tested marine sergeant being such a milktoast doesn't fly very well. I also consider it poor tactics to have acquired such treasures as the codex, the drones, and the information provided by the friendlies, and risk their loss by proceeding forward into another unknown hot zone.  In the end, I don't think highly of the character development or decisions made, but I find the basic premise interesting enough that I will try to read the sequel.",

        "reviewDescription": "At the beginning, the reawakening of Henry as a \"reconstituted mind\" or RM is somewhat reminiscent of Bob (the Bobiverse series) but Henry never integrates fully to the ship he is destined to be and starts playing second fiddle to a lot of small-time bickering between the humans on board. Throw in an AI which is stupid but has the task over overseeing Henry, it all becomes a bit of a page-filling exercise. Had trouble finishing the book and already bought part 2 as well. Not really recommended.",

        "reviewDescription": "This is book 1 in a new series by Scott Bartlett. The first thing that came to mind after reading it was wow, this is how to begin a series.The author got me right at the start of the book when he ‘killed’ off the main character with a flying lawnmower and made him into a sentient AI. One of the main threads running through the book is how the various characters interact and treat the sentient AI that used to be alive.The story takes us on a journey through near and far space in order to evaluate and deal with a possible/probable threat to Earth. The story was fun, interesting and moved at a good pace. It takes place over 80 years (the travel time to the far space location). The author continued to build on the plot and the characters as the book went along. There are incidents that occur during the 80 years that affect both the ship and crew. The ending of this book leads into the next, which the author is in the process of researching and developing.I found the main characters to be well written and relatable. They were interesting and their actions were usually, based on their personality, what you would expect. There were characters that I liked and some I didn’t (again, based on their personality or actions).I thought the tech the author created was good and reasonable based on what could be available in the near future.I thoroughly enjoyed the book, gave it 5 stars and I recommend it based on the above.",

        "reviewDescription": "The Farmer series was just a wonderful series of escapades.  \"High Tech\"; AI; furious beastly predators; evil scheming villains; heroic good guys; some PG romance; miracles that \"save the day\"--it had it all.SO...with proven capability in his art and his audience, the author expands his story and his core themes with flare and competence.  Old friends resurface; new allies are found; loaded with \"PEW PEW PEW\" battles; hints of BIG THINGS SIMMERING--just a fun romp.  It's a quick and easy read, and it held my attention until the end.  If you want deep thinking, explorations of philosophy, evocative/profound description, etc, then go read War and Peace [I dare you to finish it; I didn't].  But to \"get away from it all\" and KNOWING that truth and justice and honor will always win in the end, you can't go wrong with this.  Eagerly awaiting the next book in series.",

While the new series is able to stand on its own, it’s linkage to the earlier Star Farmer and Pirates of the Milky Way creates a broad, fascinating universe in which his characters can evolve and develop. Highly enjoyable read - and I’m definitely looking forward to the rest of the series! Especially as the new books will drop frequently - minimizing the waiting for the next/continued adventure.",

Arriving at Athos station where he expects to work as a miner, he encounters two Phaethon Corp employees and joins in their adventure.Mr. Reed is off to another great start with this new series, full of running firefights, chutes and ladders style hollowed out asteroids, and the sly humor present in the previous Milky Way books. There are some fantasy elements here too, with the outer space version of Imps, Ogres, and Trolls making an appearance. Some well placed appearances by Tom Savage help tie everything together.This is a really fun read and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.",

        "reviewDescription": "If you have read the first 3 books in this series, you already know that this series is truly a space opera as the subtitle suggests - grand, a bit pretentious and pleasantly moralizing about the human condition.  Revolution succinctly tells the tale of what happens when life gets too good for a society’s citizens - they tear it down.  All the volumes have been amazingly engaging - it is hard to put down.  Imaginative, and with a lot of action sequences- and most importantly the author keeps things moving, with no long slogs through exposition that plagues many other long multi-volume series.  Character development is light (in keeping with opera) and the technical aspects plausible enough not to distract.  Well done, Mr. Bartlett!",

    "bookDescription": "After a risky hyperspace jump, Captain Archer Devereaux arrives in an uninhabited sector of the Orion Spur.He finds a long-abandoned ship with technology far advanced beyond any known in his region of space. Even more puzzling, the ship is of human construction. As the ship regains functionality, traps left by mutineers threaten the lives of Archer and the tiny crew aboard the derelict.When he succeeds in bringing Defender back to Alliance space, an idealistic scientist posts critical information regarding Defender’s advanced technology. The Nemeans and Scyllans press for peace talks—a delaying tactic while they evaluate the information dump. When they learn that implementation is at least a year away, they break the truce violently, attempting to capture the Alliance and EU delegates during peace talks on Earth.Archer suffers devastating losses in the attack, which he has difficulty processing emotionally. Bette has her own issues of this type, and the two part on uncertain terms. She then disappears, leaving a cryptic note.Defender’s Awakening is a pulse-pounding space opera of interstellar intrigue, moral dilemmas, and fragile emotional bonds. It’s perfect for fans of epic sci-fi adventures, where heroes must not only battle their foes but also control their hearts.Book 4 of a new military science fiction series from award-winning author John J. Spearman. It's perfect for fans of Rick Partlow, Nathan Lowell, and Jeffery H. Haskell!",

The book also had no ending.  The book was intriguing enough however that I plan to continue on to the second book of this trilogy.",

It was his chance for redemption.\nUntil everything went wrong.\nThe cave should have been deserted. The perfect place to hide. Instead, it’s crawling with soldiers and engineers working to unearth the impossible:\nExcalibur.\nDeep beneath the mountain, she’s waited centuries to be found. Not a sword in the stone, but a starship. And according to the onboard AI, Thomas is the only one who can command her.\nNow he's on the run across a galaxy more astonishing and treacherous than he ever imagined, where magic and technology intertwine and ancient powers lurk in the shadows. Relentlessly hunted and hopelessly lost, he needs to learn fast if he wants to survive. Only his greatest challenge isn't training to pilot a starship. It's accepting that he, of all people, is responsible for reigniting the hope of a fallen kingdom.\nKing Arthur’s legend may be complete, but his is just beginning…",

There are moments in the story that the author describes certain things more than once, but the writing doesn't lack because of it.The characters are nice and have interesting personalities. The concepts and entry level knowledge of science isn't intense and I believe that this book is particularly suited for young readers. But be warned there are some intense violent battles with magic weapons and swords however not necessarily too graphic. I'd recommend reading it a little yourself before deciding on whether this book is right for your kids if you're worried about that.:)The plotline can be a little predictable at times and at other times might throw a few twists your way. The grammar flows well and you find yourself often rooting for the protagonist.In summary I recommend this book if your looking for a new series to fill in time between other series or if you have a particular wish to read this series.",

I hope when I get my book published it will give others the joy your book has given me. I have enjoyed Syfy for many years now and at 70 I find that in so many ways it has a way of imitating real life. It can explain old mysteries in new ways that are not only entertaining but also therapeutic and even healing. Life is an amazing thing filled with so many unexplained things and Syfy stories are able to help give us a small view of a universe of possibilities if we keep an open mind to them. Thank you again for your story. I can't wait to read the next chapter in Thomas's adventure.",

Many of them deep and dark, with implications that reach back to the time when he himself walked the Earth on two legs.In some ways, humanity has become more alien than the extraterrestrials. And if Henry can't figure out what this means - fast - he's going to have serious problems keeping himself and his crew safe.Download I, Starship: The Earth We Knew and grab the edge of your seat for this bold new space opera.",

        "reviewDescription": "Books 3 and 4 of the I, Starship series find the RM Sgt Henry Morgan and the crew of the Interchange far from home and moving from pickle.to pickle.Book 3 is a sort of coming of age story for Henry, focusing on him as the ship travels between systems, watching him grapple with his growth and the psychological implications of his existence. His internal journey provides the basis of a strong story and I enjoyed it very much.Book 4 was more of a political thriller, as the ship finds itself caught up in a system's cycle of revolution and counter-revelution. Henry is forced to take an even bigger hand in the action, and the book ends with a sinister cliffhanger that will keep us eagerly awaiting the release of Book 5.Also, as always, kudos to Mark Boyett's narration for providing depth and humanity (even in Henry's case) to Bartlett's story and characters.",

The second book seemed to imply some benefit of a reconstructed mind over standard human ability, and this book looked as if it were going to address problems associated with an RM going insane.  No. nothing. nada.  We make stupid demands, and brilliantly lucky combat tactics that end up with our getting our way while losing all or friends.  I've got a sour taste in my mouth.",

He also continues to build out the main characters including the RM (Reconstituted Mind, formerly Sergeant Henry Morgan). I enjoyed the direction the author took us once the ships arrived back out our solar system. Earth is in dire shape for a few reasons (sorry, no spoilers).This is another very good read by Scott Barlett and I can’t wait for the next book to come out.

        "reviewTitle": "A fun read, for the most part",
        "reviewDescription": "I really enjoyed this book.  It's an amalgamation of Horatio Hornblower, Star Trek, and Tom Clancy. The British versus the Soviets in outer space. Sounds strange, but it works. I particularly liked the fact that, unlike Star Trek, there are enlisted people, and they play a significant role in the story.The battle scenes, and the military technology employed, were particularly well done.Two minor quibbles. There was altogether too much saluting. Neither the British not the American navies salute indoors. Unless you are covered (wearing a hat) you cannot render a salute. Second, it's a fallacy that there can only be one captain on a ship. U. S. Navy aircraft carriers have two, and usually three. The captain of the ship is a Captain O-6. The CAG, the commander of the air wing, is also a Captain O-6. And, since most carriers have an admiral embarked, his assistant is called the Flag Captain, and is also a Captain O-6. Furthermore, a captain in the Marines is a different rank entirely, an O-3, equivalent to a Lieutenant in the Navy. So there would have been no reason to promote the Captain of the Marine detachment to Major.The military quibbles aside, I did have one significant problem with the book, which is why I didn't give it five stars.  At around the 50% mark, Captain Halberd is assigned to go on a publicity tour, during which he has affairs with multiple women.  I found the politics boring and the sex disgusting.  I think the book would have been better without that entire episode.Nonetheless, I would read the next book in the series, if it were available on Kindle Unlimited. I'm too cheap to pay for it.",

I would have expected her to bring some reason into the story to counter the captain, but she goes off the rails, and starts taking attitude, and being disrespectful.

All this because Earth has noticed alarming activity out in the stars.  Humanity has built the first and most advanced spacecraft ever built to investigate and hopefully stop the systematic destruction noted out by Alpha Centuri. The trip will take in excess is 82 years requiring the crew to go into cryo sleep on a 10 year rotational basis. They need a “human” mind that can think out of the box (no pun intended) and not tire.  AI’s can’t.  They can only do as they are programmed.  Sounds great!  But no.  The captain hates AI’s. Others have put an AI inline to monitor and restrict Henry.  What can go wrong?!There is drama, strife, hopelessness, loss and a whole gamut of issues form the crew and Henry.  I really like how the author humanizes Henry, including how can a human mind remain sane in an environment where there is no sleep, no one to talk to due to the crew in cryo, other than a “by the book, unyielding AI that can’t recognize serious issues!Sorry for being long winded.  In short… this is a good book to read!  Enjoy it!",

The other issue was the Marine group who would purposely damage or obstruct equipment, including theft and used to keep them alive is also hard to follow. I was also surprised the Cats would not have used the laser system to fight with when they found it was previously used when they realised they were out numbered with heavy fighting ships",

        "reviewDescription": "‘Pursuing knowledge merely for the sake of knowing renders knowledge itself valueless.”This book is a masterful blend of suspense and profound storytelling that kept me eagerly turning pages well into the night.What truly sets this book apart is its depth. The characters are richly developed, each with unique backstories and motivations that add complexity to the story.“It was hard to fathom that living beings could do this sort of thing to each other, and then go on to celebrate it.”The author has crafted an intricate plot that is both engaging and thought-provoking. . I found myself deeply invested in their journeys, particularly the protagonist, whose struggles and triumphs are portrayed with authenticity and emotional depth.“It was a scary thought, of course: that there was no goodness, really, but only chance and power.”Can’t wait to read The Earth We Knew #3!",

        "reviewDescription": "This is the first book of a space-based Science Fiction series. As such, it gives some background and current-day events before getting into the 'meat' of the story.The story starts out focusing on Jace. He's a military combat veteran of the opposition forces to the current government. This led to him spending time in a government prison. Upon his release, his only viable option for employment is to work for a shadowy organization. The only reason he remains on his home planet and works for them is to assist his ailing mother and his retired combat veteran father. As the story unfolds, Jace is forced into making hard decisions that affect his future.As a reader, I love that the book had a touch of mystery and intrigue. I'm looking forward to reading the next books in the series.Disclaimer: I was invited, along with other readers, to read this book. I voluntarily agreed to do so. Above are my honest thoughts on this book.",

        "reviewDescription": "Archer Devereaux can't get a break.  An up & coming young navalofficer in the Phlegraean fleet, his career took a nose dive whenhe was found sleeping with the wife of his commanding officer.  Hehad no idea who she was, and that in fact she had specially pickedhim out because she was furious at her husband (it turned out sheactually liked Devereaux, so she was sorry about it, but damagedone).  The fleet is not particularly puritan, and everything wasconsensual and out of the chain of command, so Arch was cleared,officially.  Unofficially, his name was mud, especially with Academygraduates.The outbreak of war, and his ongoing success in battle, along withthe turnover of war-revealed dead-wood in the Admiralty ranks seemto have Devereaux's star on the rise again, but somehow he keepsgetting assigned to diplomatic missions which always end in bloodand disorder for some (as yet mysterious) reason.These are very straight-forward, low-key \"He did this, and then hedid that\" books which work better in that presentation than youmight think.  The battles are low-key as well.  Ships are veryexpensive and it is uncommon to have more than three on each sideengaging.  Space is also large, so there is a lot of hunt & seekwith weeks between engagements, and people are people, so there isalways backbiting and corruption in high places.  There is also onewoman who keeps turning up in all of Arch's troubles (sometimesseemingly as the cause of them), and she may be The One, though,as I said, it's a pretty casual setting, and Arch manages to findother friendly companionship (with benefits) along the way.",

        "reviewDescription": "But the space navy battles lack some essential details. There’s never any issues with detecting enemy ships. In fact there’s no mention of how ships are detected at all. There’s no real question of communications, or emissions control. Drones can explode on or near ships. Why aren’t the drones carrying nuclear warheads? Why aren’t they using nuclear bomb pumped laser fire?Everyone has FTL communications nearly all the time. It seems to me that would allow headquarters to micromanage operations, just as happens in our reality.Why did the fleet merger conference have about zero security? As soon as the details were revealed, I thought, “Ut oh, there’s trouble.”Computer security in the book is not as good as it was in the 1960s in the US. It seems like bad actors can do as they wish to computer systems without any problems.For a better example of the genre, read Chain of Command, by Frank Chadwick.",

        "reviewTitle": "Gripping and Thoughtful",
        "reviewDescription": "Starship Troopers is an amazing novel and almost nothing like that abortion of a movie by Verhoeven, who thought Heinlein a Neo-Fascist. That’s his depiction in the movie, but it doesn’t resemble the novel except very superficially. Frankly, it’s a scandal that a man was given the job of directing the adaptation to intentionally smear the novel, its ideas, and the man, himself.  But, on to the novel...It’s vintage Heinlein—imaginative, but with a tangible flavor of realism and an accurate anthropology. The characters are well-developed and the action satisfying. One of the unique things about Heinlein is his strong sense of the moral and an interesting aspect of this novel, in particular, is the political moral philosophy that underpins it—the notion that the only people that should have political power (the voter franchise) are those that have demonstrated the moral commitment of sacrifice for society—indeed, the human race. That is, those unwilling to put society above their own interests are unfit to wield political power, which amounts to the authority to wield force and violence. Philosophers and theologians have observed similar things. For example, Martin Luther’s concept of the Left-Hand Kingdom, asserts similar concepts—the State wields the sword for the benefit of society (and, for Luther, The Church) to create order and protect people from chaos and threats. Heinlein has his own twist on these ideas. They’re intriguing—and, convincing.It’s also my understanding that this is the first Sci-Fi novel to realistically depict military life. I can’t say for sure, because I have an insufficient understanding of the Sci-Fi cannon and I’ve never served in the military. Heinlein did know military life, as he graduated from the US Naval Academy and served 5 years as a naval officer before being retired because of an illness—tuberculosis, I believe.  All I can say is that it is believable. It doesn’t just focus on the actions and action, but the inner life, attitudes, and thought patterns of the military man (and woman). Needless to say, the movie completely misses the mark on this point also.I first read this novel decades ago and thought it terrific then—well, no surprise there, since it won the Hugo Award before the award was infested by political correctness. I thought it worth a re-read, especially in today’s political climate—the ideas here won’t be popular with people who think that government (really, other people) owes them free stuff. Even after decades, there were certain scenes that had stuck in my mind all that time. If you believe that the mark of a successful novel is its ability to stick in your mind, then this novel delivers in spades. Still, after reading it again I was surprised by how many substantive things I had forgotten, which is a testament to its depth.Originally marketed as one of Heinlein’s juvenile novels, it really doesn’t fit well in that genre. It’s shorter than many of his novels, but not as short as the juveniles such as “Have Spacesuit, Will Travel” (my favorite Heinlein novel of that genre). This is a serious book that explores serious ideas, so adults will find it satisfying. Nevertheless, I do recommend it for young adults. We’d do well to make it a regular part of the literature cannon taught in late middle school and high school, as it forces one to think about the relationship between responsibilities and rights, as well as economic concepts such as “value” and markets. If people are to be voting citizens, then they should be familiar with the ideas in this novel, even if they ultimately disagree with them. You can’t have a useful opinion on the concepts, though, if you don’t know what they are. Thinking about ideas is never a waste.",

        "reviewDescription": "I first read “Starship Troopers” when it was first published in 1959, right after I graduated from high school. Now, 64 years later, I have read it once more. I am a retired submarine officer who came up through the ranks like Rico. As I look back on my life through the lens of this remarkable book, I can see that it played a significant role in who I became.Some critics have panned “Starship Troopers” as nothing more than a series of civics infodumps interspersed with a thin storyline. While I understand where they come from, I disagree with that characterization. From what I know about Heinlein (I never met him), he led the libertarian wing of hard science fiction throughout the 50s, 60s, and 70s. He had a keen understanding of what Ayn Rand called the “Objective Universe.” He saw what had happened to the United States in his time (the 1950s), compared with what the founders had created. With insight clearer than virtually anyone else back then, he saw how things could be. “Starship Troopers” is a novel that shows exactly how his vision might be realized. He didn’t tell us how to do it, but rather showed us what it would be like if we did it. Throughout the novel, he regales us with the thoughts of experts who expound to their captive students on their conception (and, of course, Heinlein’s conception) of what he calls “History and Moral Philosophy.” These lectures, that comprise an integral part of the novel, became the underpinnings of who I became as an officer and a man.As I look back on my life of 82 years, I can see how profoundly Heinlein’s “History and Moral Philosophy” affected me personally. Ironically, in my post-military career, I write hard science fiction. I do not consciously emulate Heinlein, but my award-winning writings have frequently been compared to his—something I take as a great compliment.The bottom line here is, no matter what you may have heard about “Starship Troopers,” read it, and you will gain a new perspective on how things are and how they might be. I highly recommend it without equivocation. It is one of the very best hard science fiction novels ever written.",

        "reviewDescription": "Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers has finally made it in ebook form to the kindle, i've been waiting for this for a while and having never read it before I can happily say it was worth the wait and I can see why to many it is a classic. Those of you who have seen the films (I love the first and detest the others) may have a vague idea of the plot but the films are a pale imitation missing so much the book has to offer.The story follows the career of Johnnie Rico as a Trooper for the federation in a far off fascist future. Despite being a military sci-fi novel it has a surprising amount of political commentary running throughout adding an interesting layer of depth that a lot of modern military sci-fi novels really lack. In the future the only people that can vote have to have worked for the federation to earn citizenship, they have to have earned the right and put the good of the whole above the individual but it's not that simple as Johnnie finds out.Though Rico's reason for joining started as a political choice it soon turns into the look at the life of a mobile infantry trooper, over half the book is about his training alone, about what really makes a soldier in the future. Most of the cadets don't make it through training, nevermind to serve their term to be citizens.The way Starship Troopers is written from Johnnies point of view makes everything remarkably clear as the poor lad is as confused about events as the reader so nothing is left unexplained yet it never gets bogged down or feels slow, it's all pretty engrossing.I think that's what was so good about it, yes the bug war is mentioned towards the end but there's no resolution. It's not a book about saving worlds, about good vs evil, there's no distinct point. Just a career view of a trooper in a politically different future. It's a fascinating read I recommend to any sci-fi fan.+ Interesting political sub theme.+ Rico's training is detailed.+ Well written universe, clear and concise.+ Interesting plot focus, a little different.",

The story is not stretched way too much as it happens with some contemporary SF books and the end is not an absurd cliffhanger to let the readers waiting for the next installment. It is basically auto-conclusive thouhg it lets the things rather open and in a good sense. All in all, this is perhaps one of the best books in the saga and it points to fresh developments that fit with the previous ones.Just one or two tiny details that rubbed me wrong. For instance, Alex keeps on calling \"sir\" to every sargent and NCO she founds and no one of them chews her out for that. And burbers and PRC do not mix but in the first books of the series they mixed basically OK...",

Van is a minimum of one-half Hu'warde because his Mother Jocelyn is also Hu'warde. This appears to be a grievous error made by Author Maggert. Its highly doubtful that J. N. Chaney would've made an error of this magnitude. I have read too many books in series by that Author Chaney that had no issues with continuity.  So I will lay the blame at the feet of the Secondary Author Terry Maggert, the beta readers, and the Editor. Let's not forget the AI that somehow missed the Family Tree legend in the Preview area in the front of this book.  Disappointing to read that knowing so many did not take the opportunity to update that paragraph. To await months for this book to finally arrive, makes this error absolutely difficult to digest.",

        "reviewDescription": "This book had just about everything... Warp speed! Impulse engines! Exploding consoles! and a complete absence of seatbelts! Apparently the technology for seat restraints was lost in some earlier era.Aside from that, for its length, this book did a great job of creating characters, building a story, and keeping your attention! It's a great tale of a bunch of greenies showing courage under fire, and a captain doing everything in his power to save lives! It's also a story of a bunch of young engineers rallying behind their captain and giving it all to get the job done!It's not hard sci-fi, and it's not Hamlet. But it does what it is meant to do; entertain. So if you like books that harken back to the golden years of sci-fi, with bodies flying from explosions, enemy vessels that dwarf anything the good guys have, and people facing odds that would make you crawl in an escape pod, hit the eject and self-destruct buttons at the same time, you'll like this book!",

        "reviewTitle": "An excellent read, albeit flawed by hard science",
        "reviewDescription": "This is an extremely well written novel, entertaining and enthralling.  It kept me engaged from the first page to the last - in fact, I enjoyed it so much that having first borrowed it on Kindle Unlimited, I then bought a copy, to give the author the benefit of double earning.  I'm looking forward to the next two books in the series.That said, the book's major flaw - and it's a big one - is that it ignores the limitations of hard science in so blatant a way as to make it difficult to suspend disbelief.  I'm not talking about standard tropes like faster-than-light travel, or that sort of thing:  almost every SF author uses them, and we're used to them.  What grates is when a spaceship can brake from speeds greater than light to a standstill in the time it takes to read this sentence, or when a spaceship is used to ram another spaceship at faster-than-light speeds.  You and I know that even the barest touch of ship upon ship at such speeds would produce one of the most stupendous explosions in the galaxy, and utterly destroy both craft;  yet, in this book, it becomes a tactic that the hero uses more than once.  At low speeds (I'm talking tens, rather than hundreds or thousands of miles per hour) ramming becomes feasible.  Any faster, and it's a non-starter (except as a rather flashy way to commit suicide).  For such flaws, I had to deduct one star from what would otherwise have been a five-star review.However, the book is still very entertaining, and I liked it enough that I've pre-ordered the next two volumes in the series.  I just wish the author would be a bit more careful in crossing the scientifically believable line!",

The action was remorseless yet gripping and with different scenarios each major event. I dare say that much didn't conform to our current understanding of physics, but it was handled in such a way that it didn't seem to matter.The central character was unexpectedly thrust into his role but rose to the occasion and became a genuine hero, a natural leader... all whilst coming across as a thoroughly pleasant character, doubts and fears not withstanding.I don't often give 5 stars but I didn't feel I could do otherwise in this case... and I am seriously considering buying the remaining 2 books in the series, although book 2 is based on a planet.",

Update: thought I should clarify. Almost every sentence is separated by a blank line. In a few cases, a few sentences may form a paragraph, but most commonly every sentence is separated like a paragraph. Reading this is a bit like trying to read while traveling down a road full of potholes, you keep getting jarred and have to take a second to get back to where you were. A well written book should flow, word to word, sentence to sentence, and paragraph to paragraph leading the reading smoothly through the story. This book is the direct opposite of that.",

Since then I’ve purchased everything I can find of Mr Reed’s work & re-read most of them (at least once) along the way. Top Duck is no exception. My only complaint - I wanted more at the finish. Bear in mind each book in these series are interconnected and have cliffhangers. Good thing is that you never have to wait for long to get the next instalment. Not for anyone who can’t deal with some death and mayhem along the way. I’m eagerly awaiting Book 3 - what a great Christmas present.

The galaxy’s deadliest secrets.\nThe rebellion has begun, but Jace Hawthorne and the crew of the Revenant quickly learn that freedom carries a steep price.

Trust is scarce, and betrayal festers within Rising Dawn. Jace must rely only on his closest allies or risk watching the rebellion collapse from within.\nThe Overlords want the galaxy broken. Jace intends to make them bleed for it.\nRelic Fleet is the relentless second installment in the Shadow of War series. Fans of fast-paced space operas, alien mysteries, and desperate fights for survival will be on the edge of their seats.",

        "reviewDescription": "Jace Hawthorne and Caera Frost uncover an Eldra'kaarn warship, the Revenant. Only Jace and his cat, Shadow, are imbued with the temporal microbes that allow him to communicate with and control Revenant. Until they find more of the Eldra'kaarn microbes, only Jace can use any of the functions of the warship and he has a lot to learn. Fortunately, the Revenant AI, ECHO, helps him use the ship functions and weapons. In addition to some pretty advanced weaponry, Revenant has powerful shields and the ability to cloak and move unseen. Delivering the warship to the Rising Dawn is the plan, but until more Eldra'kaarn microbes are found only Jace can operate the Revenant. Can one ship make a difference against the Overlords? Even one as powerful as the Revenant?Powerful characters fill the cast of the Rising Dawn and Revenant. The Revenant is a pretty potent character itself with ECHO speaking for the warship. Jace, Son of the Lion, is saddled with high expectations. Is he stepping up? We'll see. Jace's romance with Caera is back-burnered by their duties to Revenant and Rising Dawn, but it still simmers. Shadow is another mysterious character, slinking around and appearing mysteriously in unexpected parts of the warship. Rising Dawn is a strong presence in the storyline, demanding allegiance and providing hope in a hopeless galaxy. The storyline presents one action-packed adventure after another! No time to catch your breath between sequences of combat, preparation and execution! This is another great read!",

For example, in the first book when it started there was no artificial gravity in the ships, but now artificial gravity seems to be taken for granted. Then there is the shields, in the beginning we were told that only the Revenant had shields but in a battle in this book the author writes about the Revenant’s weapon penetrating the enemy ship shields.I’m not sure if a plan to continue this series.

The concept of the story is interesting enough that I went back days later and started the second book in hopes that maybe the author's agent might have banged some sense into the writers head.

    "bookDescription": "After a decade, acclaimed science fiction master John Scalzi returns to the galaxy of the Old Man's War series with the long awaited seventh book, The Shattering PeaceTHE PEACE IS SHATTERINGFor a decade, peace has reigned in interstellar space. A tripartite agreement between the Colonial Union, the Earth, and the alien Conclave has kept the forces of war at bay, even when some would have preferred to return to the fighting and struggle of former times. For now, more sensible heads have prevailed – and have even championed unity.But now, there is a new force that threatens the hard-maintained peace: The Consu, the most advanced intelligent species humans have ever met, are on the cusp of a species-defining civil war. This war is between Consu factions... but nothing the Consu ever do is just about them. The Colonial Union, the Earth and the Conclave have been unwillingly dragged into the conflict, in the most surprising of ways.Gretchen Trujillo is a mid-level diplomat, working in an unimportant part of the Colonial Union bureaucracy. But when she is called to take part in a secret mission involving representatives from every powerful faction in space, what she finds there has the chance to redefine the destinies of humans and aliens alike... or destroy them forever.OTHER TOR BOOKS BY JOHN SCALZIAgent to the StarsThe Android’s DreamFuzzy NationRedshirtsYour Hate Mail Will Be Graded:A Decade of Whatever, 1998–2008The Kaiju Preservation SocietyStarter VillainWhen the Moon Hits Your EyeTHE OLD MAN’S WAR NOVELSOld Man’s WarThe Ghost BrigadesThe Last ColonyZoë’s TaleThe Human DivisionThe End of All ThingsTHE LOCK IN SERIESLock InHead OnUnlockedTHE INTERDEPENDENCY SEQUENCEThe Collapsing EmpireThe Consuming FireThe Last EmperoxEDITED BY JOHN SCALZIMetatropolisAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

I would strongly recommend that you read the first six books before Shattering Peace.Gretchen, the protagonist of Shattering Peace, tells us that she was Zoe Perry's best friend. I remember John Perry (the original protagonist), his wife Jane Sagan, and their adopted daughter Zoe. I don't recall Gretchen but that's fine. (Gretchen knows her stuff so it doesn't matter how well she knew Zoe.)John Perry was a soldier. Gretchen is a diplomat. We are now at a point where keeping the peace is critical. No one wants war to break out again.Gretchen is summoned to deal with a diplomatic crisis. For this she gets an Obin assistant, Ran.  I particularly enjoyed the Obin Ran. I enjoy well-drawn alien races.The Consu are back, and the first one Gretchen meets is suicidal. The story goes on from there.I found Shattering Peace an immensely enjoyable read. The writing is both smart and snarky. Classic Scalzi. And why I love this series.",

    "bookDescription": "We were fighting on the wrong side, of a war we couldn't win. And that was the good news. The Ruhar hit us on Columbus Day. There we were, innocently drifting along the cosmos on our little blue marble, like the native Americans in 1492. Over the horizon come ships of a technologically advanced, aggressive culture, and BAM! There go the good old days, when humans only got killed by each other. So, Columbus Day. It fits. When the morning sky twinkled again, this time with Kristang starships jumping in to hammer the Ruhar, we thought we were saved. The UN Expeditionary Force hitched a ride on Kristang ships to fight the Ruhar, wherever our new allies thought we could be useful. So, I went from fighting with the US Army in Nigeria, to fighting in space. It was lies, all of it. We shouldn't even be fighting the Ruhar, they aren't our enemy, our allies are. I'd better start at the beginning....A selection of scenes from Columbus Day:There was a faint click, and the other door popped open a quarter inch. Cautiously, I pulled it open and stuck my head in. Beyond the door was a warehouse, maybe fifty feet by thirty, twenty feet tall, filled with racks of what I thought was mostly old, useless, dirty, dusty broken junk. I wandered in cautiously. Why the Ruhar had made the effort to store any of it made no sense to me. Surely there had to be something in there that I could use as a weapon.A man’s voice, with a snarky attitude, rang out behind me. “Excellent! Bipedal, 1300cc brain, opposable thumbs. A hairless monkey. You can carry me out of here.”I spun around in a panic. No one was there. “Who said that?”“Me. Here, I’m the shiny cylinder on the shelf. I unlocked that door.\"“You are? You mean you’re talking to me through a speaker in that thing?”“No, I am that thing. I am what you monkeys call an artificial intelligence.”I cocked my head and examined it skeptically. “You look like a chrome-plated beer can.\" That was a completely accurate description. The cylinder even tapered slightly at the top, and was ringed by a ridge. \"You’re really an AI?\"\"Yup. You should refer to me as The Lord God Almighty.”“That position is already filled. I think I’ll call you Skippy.”“Don’t call me that, it sounds disrespectful, monkey.”“You prefer shithead? Because that’s the other option, Skippy-O.” I kept glancing around, fearing the Ruhar would hear me.“Can we compromise on The Great and Powerful Oz?” It asked.“I’m not a flying monkey, so that’s a no, Skippy.”“Unacceptable.”“How about we go for something more formal, like Skippy McSkippster?”“No.”“Skippy Skipperson? Skippy Skippkowski? Skippy Von Skipping? Or maybe Sir Skippy Skippton-Skippersworth?”“No, no, no and NO!”“I can go on like this all day.”“I believe you could.”\"What you got?\" Ski asked.Cornpone winked. \"Uh, let's see. Damn! I got a gen-u-ine smorgasbord of Hooah! bars.\"\"A smorgasbord?\" I asked skeptically. \"Really?\"\"Oh yeah, a smorgasbord at least. Could be a plethora, maybe even, oooh, an honest to God, gosh-darned corn-u-copia of snack foods.\" It was funny to hear Jesse say 'plethora' in his deep southern accent.\"Cut the bullshit, man, you're making me hungry.\" Ski protested. \"What flavors you got in there?\"\"Well, I got Cinnamon Cardboard, of course, also Raisins 'n' Gravel, and, my personal fave, Original Sawdust.\"Crap. I got stuck with Raisin 'n' Gravel. The raisins were harder to chew than the gravel.“Space combat sounds complicated.” I thought back to when I’d listened to the Chicken pilot talk about air combat after our first war game, on Camp Alpha.“Uh huh. Then there’s the Skippy factor.”Part of me wanted to avoid taking the bait. “The Skippy factor?”“You know, my incredible awesomeness.”",

        "reviewDescription": "Great book even for a non-scifi fan such as myself. Generally speaking if I have to choose between magic or science in my books I always go for magic.  So what made me pick this one up you might ask?  That's simple.  I wax a road trip with my scifi loving husband and listening to bits a piece of this series on Audible.  That's how I fell in love with the character Skippy.  I think he really adds the much needed comic relief this book needed to bring home all the elements of a truly entertaining story.When my husband told me about this book series he said I'd love it because Skippy is just like Bob from The Dresden Files but an AI instead of spirit.  And that got my attention piqued, cuz, in my opinion, The Dresden Files is the absolute best urban fantasy series out there.  And Bob is definitely a favorite among many, many great unique characters.  And Expeditionary Force: Columbus Day did not disappoint.When I picked it up, I originally I would be just reading it for Skippy, because that bits I'd heard with Skippy while on road trips liking to the audio book were hilarious.  But, much to my surprise, I found myself enjoying the book right from the beginning. And that is factoring that Skipoy doesn't even show up until around the middle  of the book.  It doesn't bog you with to much nerdy scifi tech talk.  The story is a great easy read right from the start with Joe being a really relatable, easy to like character.  And right about when the book could srguable have died from the story stagnating from repeating themes the author expertly and suddenly takes the story on a dramatic 90° turn with the entrance of Skippy.At this point, Skippy could have easily taken over the story if it weren't for Joe's ability to ground Skippy's ego more the realms of us hairless monkey's idea of reality.  The two play off of each other so well it's almost like  a expertly choreographed dance.Bottom line, it's a very entertaining book to read and I highly reccomend it.  And if you're more of a magic or Dersden Files  fan then I think you will enjoy this book too.",

        "reviewDescription": "This is a simply outstanding series.  I am very glad that I discovered it AFTER he wrote four books so that I wouldn't go into serious withdrawal issues upon completing Columbus Day.  It's original, clever, funny, and a real delight.You have an ordinary Joe who just wants to serve his country and go home, but he finds himself in the middle of an interplanetary invasion by...hamsters.  Yes, the aliens are similar to bipedal hamsters.  Alanson had me right there.  Hamsters?He gets a scratch team together and manages to capture two aliens.  He treats them well and turns them over to the authorities, figures that's the end of it.  The war goes on, and another alien army shows up.  They conquer the hamsters and seem to enlist Earth as an ally.  They're lizards, and you know you just can't trust lizards.Earth sends military forces out with the lizard ships, ostensibly to be trained and used in the war against the hamsters, but they end up on the hamster planet as occupation forces.  Joe is semi-famous for capturing hamsters on Earth, but here he's considered trouble, and the plan is to station him at a remote area where he can't make more trouble.He befriends a hamster official who turns out to be in charge of the hamster government, and learns a lot more about their supposed allies, the lizards.  They aren't allies...just slave labor in training for the lizard overlords.  Yet another alien nation is participating in this messy war, but they're mainly support and transport.  They don't get into the messy stuff, just deliver lizard ships and supplies.You can't tell the players without a score card in this interstellar war zone, and Joe realizes humanity has been duped into helping the equivalent of space Nazis in their regime.  He tries to get the information to the decision-makers, only to discover that he's in more trouble...and then in jail, awaiting execution.  He's locked in a makeshift cell with some stuff stored in it, and there he finds an ancient alien Artificial Intelligence unit who is millions of years old, knows everything, and is bored out of his little metal gourd.  He actually occupies a huge volume of space in another dimension, but in this one, he's manifested as something like a silver beer can with an attitude.With the help of Skippy, the AI, Joe and a few other prisoners escape and try to save themselves...and planet Earth, a wormhole away from their present location.I love this series, and in fact, went ahead and bought all four of the main books so that I could find out how this all went.  There are some minor editing issues (you and  your, omitted words, phrases that were \"test-driven\" and not used, which should have been removed.  The story is good enough that I'll put up with that stuff just to find out what happens to our merry band of space pirates next.  After all, that's what they are.  Pirates operating under the guidance of an ancient intelligence who can manipulate computer systems, wormholes, and so much more, particularly with the help of the \"monkeys,\" his term for humans.",

        "reviewDescription": "It took me awhile to make it past the first few chapters that were building the world and setting up the future, but once the story actually got going, it was a great time.I enjoy the very military mindset of the characters and how it's written. It feels more believable than some military stories, where it's obvious that someone knows the words, but never lived the life. This one, I could believe the author was familiar with the military lifestyle rather than just aware of it.Skippy is annoying, abrasive, yet still very likable. Sometimes he seems a little too much Skippy, but there is some growth that happens and it's good to see that. I'm also glad he's not right all the time.Well, the book is mostly well written. I did find a couple few errors here and there, mostly grammatical. All in all a very good book. Would recommend, will check out the next one.",

You'll find yourself wanting to find out more about the next chapter as the story develops.The characters all have different personalities and you'll quickly become invested in their individual stories and fight for survival.If you're not a big reader, give the audiobook a try.

The tapestry of alien races, each one with their own motives and each one with some individual characters is extremely well done. Mr. Alanson has the knack of describing characters that *are interesting*, that is: after some pages you really care for what is going to happen to a lot of them.And the action of the plot is a freight train on the loose. It's true as well that some lines of the plot are repetitive, with the same characters making similar things, but it is son neatly done that you not only don't care, but you do expect it to be resolved thus.I am really expecting book number 9 and I thank Mr. alanson for the very good moments he has given me with all of them.That said, I too think Joe should get laid more.",

For every ship that leaves earth orbit, twenty arrive, and some have ill intent.Then, things get interesting.The Six Stars League is coming apart at the seams, and their actions require justice. When Van and the Fist intervene, they aren't alone—the GKU is there to lend a hand, and they arrive in new, lethal ships totally unknown to the Fist.With their secret navy, the GKU begins a competition for control of humanity among the stars—and seizure of the ultimate prize.Destroying the Stillness.For this job, Van will need bigger guns, a bigger ship, and more resolve. That means the Fafnir will be offline for a while, and other ships will have to step up. Enter Icky and Netty and the Fafnir Faithful, who decide that if one ship is good, then six ships is better.On the offensive, the Fist reaches across the stars to the distant Pleaides, deep in the big black where Stillness agents have reigned terror since Mark Tudor began his career. But if Van has learned anything, it's this:Being far from home means risk. And risk in deep space means death.But Van isn't going to fight alone, and Stillness are about to learn their final lesson.",

    "bookDescription": "Alien starships smashed our defences in a storm of missiles and laser fire… but a small human fleet escaped into space. Battle scarred but determined to fight on, they could be our last hope. Captain Jim Garrett thought his navy career was over. But when aliens attacked, he took the helm of an experimental warship, leading her into battle for the first time.Now, he commands a ragged fleet of ships that survived the alien onslaught. Their crews are inexperienced and exhausted but there’s no time to rest. Garrett must shape them into a lethal fighting force.His deadliest enemies may come from within. A rival captain threatens mutiny, furious that Garrett is now his superior. And alien infiltrators, disguised as ordinary humans, are hidden aboard every ship, with orders to destroy them no matter the cost.As a vast enemy force descends on Javelin Station, one of the last strongholds resisting the alien attack, can Garrett seize control of his fleet and strike back? Or will the station, and the freedom of humanity, be swept away by the alien tide?Off Javelin Station is an epic story of battle and adventure, packed with hard-hitting action and shocking twists.

        "reviewDescription": "Review first posted at Girl Who Reads. All opinions are my own.Captain Garrett is still in charge of a ragtag crew of survivors from Midway Station, and now he must create a lethal fighting force out of them. Alien forces aren't the only problem. A rival captain can't stand that Garrett is in charge and threatens mutiny. Alien infiltrators disguised as ordinary humans are on every ship with orders to destroy them. Javelin Station is resisting the alien attack, but can Garrett continue to save humanity?This is the second book in the series, following Off Midway Station. It picks up soon after that novel, so you absolutely have to read it in order. The survivors are now within one carrier ship, and there are growing concerns and risks. Garrett has a small group of trustworthy people, but now there are so many more to contend with. He's low on resources and time, increasing the pressure on the crew. We feel it along with the crew; the different POVs show us how the tension and threats to humanity affect not just command, but the fighter pilots and the civilians volunteering to do medical training. The threat of a different kind of war is raised as they learn about the infiltrators and thwart attacks on the ship and command.The second half of the book is all battle strategy and tactics as Garrett and his team race toward their objective. They have an experimental device, rare weapons, and their sheer size in their favor. The enemy is numerous and doesn't care how many of them are sacrificed. It's war, and battles are won by those with better tactics and more ruthlessness. The chapters run quickly, and the ending comes as a sudden stop. The overall mission isn't done yet, and the war isn't over. We're going to see more books outlining the war, with new concern regarding the infiltrators and the hidden enemy. This continues in the same vein as the first, with huge space battles and military tactics for those who enjoy the genre.",

        "reviewDescription": "In just a few short days Garrett has gone from being nearly certain that he would never command a spaceship to the commodore of a mixed fleet of ships reorganizing following a surprise attack that has the strategic command and infrastructure in shambles. It is up to him to stand tall and attempt to find answers and solutions while many around him may have different or even divergent goals.This installment is all about how Garrett attempts to become the united force of the survivors and also find answers and provide hope for the future. As always with Marc, the action is broadly focused as well as fast and furious. Friends shift and emerge, enemies are clarified and established as a short term respite is identified and fought over.Best if read immediately following  a reading, or rereading, of Off Midway Station, this well polished novel will suck you in and, as always, leave you wanting much more.",

All that she is missing is the unlit cigar in her mouth to compliment the scar on her face. She was written as a tough, no nonsense male character, then switched to female.The commodore. Has a romantic entanglement go sour on him then starts banging one of the scientists assigned to the ship. Really?

    "bookDescription": "Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is the winner of the Nebula and Hugo Awards In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.THE ENDER UNIVERSEEnder seriesEnder’s Game / Ender in Exile / Speaker for the Dead / Xenocide / Children of the MindEnder’s Shadow seriesEnder’s Shadow / Shadow of the Hegemon / Shadow Puppets / Shadow of the Giant / Shadows in FlightChildren of the FleetThe First Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)Earth Unaware / Earth Afire / Earth AwakensThe Second Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)The Swarm /The HiveEnder novellasA War of Gifts /First MeetingsAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

        "reviewDescription": "Plot:It is the future. Earth has survived an attack from an insectile alien race - barely. Population control laws are in effect. Families are limited to 2 children. Young children are monitored to see if they have military potential, and those that show promise at an early age are whisked away to train in the military's Battle School, in the hopes that by the time they reach adulthood, they will possess the necessary skills to defend the Earth, if the aliens - \"buggers\" - ever return.Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin is a rare third child in his family. His older brother and sister showed intellectual promise, but his brother was too ruthless and his sister too compassionate to qualify for Battle School. So the Wiggin parents were permitted a third chance to produce a military prodigy. And they succeeded.Ender is whisked away to Battle School at the ripe old age of 6. The School, located on a space station orbiting the Earth, is populated by military officers and child prodigies. Ender is one of the youngest.And these are not your average children.They train daily in space military tactics, weaponry, and combat. Although they are all at an age that we associate with Dora, Spongebob, and Hannah Montana, these kids are nothing like the children currently roaming your local elementary school hallway. They are calculating, intuitive, sometimes ruthless, always dangerous.One of the main focuses of the School is the battleroom, where the children are equipped with special suits and laser guns that allow them to fight each other in zero-gravity. On Ender's first trip to the battleroom, it becomes quickly apparent that he is a cut above the other students. Some of his peers respect this. Some are threatened by it.And as Ender works his way up through the ranks of Battle School, his teachers take notice, and wonder if perhaps Ender is the child they've been waiting for. The child who can change everything. The child who can save Earth.Why I Love It:Don't let the summary throw you off. Ender's Game may be a book about children, but it is by no means a book for children. The children in this book are nothing like how we picture children (as the mother of an almost-6-year-old, I can say this pretty definitively). Everything about this book is aimed at an adult audience.Ender's Game is not a thriller or adventure story, although some of the battleroom scenes are exciting. More than anything, it's an examination of the mind of Ender Wiggin, the culture he lives in, and a world under military rule. And it's all fascinating.Mr. Card writes Ender in a way that while you understand he is just a child, you can still be awed, chilled, and amazed at his thoughts and actions. As a matter of fact, all of the characters are interesting and intriguing, from his friends at the Battle School, to his sociopath brother Peter, to the Commander of the Battle School, Colonel Graff.There is a twist at the end of Ender's Game. You may see it coming; you may not. I did, but it didn't lessen my enjoyment of the book one bit. The fact that I have read this book over and over again, in spite of knowing the twist ending, speaks to the strong writing of the rest of the book. The book doesn't exist just to throw you off at the end. The book exists to make you think, to draw you completely into the character of Ender, and to absorb you in the science-fiction world he lives in.",

        "reviewDescription": "Being a first-time reader of Ender's Game at the age of 26 (perhaps late to the party), I soon came to find that this book is not by any means easy to put down. In fact, I read most of it between customers at work on my iPhone. I recall reading sci-fi quite a bit when I was in junior high and high school, but most of the novels I read were just expansions on already popular film works such as Star Trek, Star Wars, Aliens, etc. None of those were particularly memorable in having a great degree of depth, but the stories were still enjoyable. That being said however, Ender's Game is far more than just a science fiction novel. Unlike other books in the sci-fi genre, I felt compelled to pay close attention to every detail. I'm actually glad I picked it up now that I'm older and able to comprehend the complexity of emotion and ideas present in such a book--a feat which I'm sure would come at a much younger age for Ender himself.From the very first page, it's obvious that Colonel Graff is the \"bad guy\", until you later come to realize that in this book, such terms make about as much sense as floating in nullo gravity. In fact, Card's entire description of the like combined with his emphasis on the reorientation and breaking down of a young, impressionable mind through such tactics as surrounding Ender with enemies, constantly moving and pushing him, forcing him into positions that demand the most of abilities he is still too naive to realize are within him--much as he may deny them--all of it creates a constant tension. What you eventually discover about the story itself is that this tension provides just enough gravity by which to anchor the reader down before hurling you into the Battle Room, where you must then abolish your preconceived notions of what it means to be good or evil and right or wrong. In Ender's Game, these ideas are frequently challenged, frequently protested, but always justified.Everything depends on Ender's abilities as much as his willingness to continue. Whether the imminent destruction of Earth will occur or not is irrelevant to him. What matters most is his personal desire for love, happiness, and comfort, yet even these are often stripped away as inconsequential--be they from higher authority or at rare points, even by Ender himself--when it comes to his deep underlying NEED, above all, to UNDERSTAND--and therefore LOVE, in its highest form--that which he hates most. Sometimes, it is himself he hates the most. Sometimes it is Graff, other times it's the enemy of the chapter or scene. Stilson, Bonzo, Rose the Nose, etc. From any perspective you view it however, he is constantly learning and understanding more about himself as much as he understands the system. That's his journey. He knows that he entered the Battle School willingly, perhaps in order to understand himself, though he may grow to hate it. In this way, it should have been clear to him from the start that it is meant to crush him. Because he strives to understand things, because at heart he is pure. He wants to learn, to understand, and to love.But he will also crush that which he loves if he allows himself to be pushed by the wrong people. Ender is easily manipulated because of his willingness and desire to understand, and in this way, he perhaps retains a bit of his childhood innocence. He is not completely naive however, and his most brutal actions are either committed out of frustration in not being able to understand or not being able to communicate on the same level--this is consequentially the same plight the Formics faced in their first dealings with the human race, and so it comes as no surprise that Ender is able to relate to them.Above all, it hits on some age-old questions. Why can't we communicate with each other? Why can we not understand? And is it sometimes futile to attempt to understand? For when you believe you have the answer to everything, it's not always so obvious as you thought. Can evil actions be justified in the name of self-preservation and war? What happens to soldiers when the war and its intensity are over, how can they re-adjust from such a grueling life, and how can they live with the lives they have taken?There are many questions this book both asks and answers, and of course such answers will all depend on how you are able to reorient yourself in a zero-gravity environment. This book has made me look at life and human interaction in a very different way, and despite that I may not agree with the author's personal views, I can sure appreciate his talent in crafting such a great story...especially one that renews and strengthens my own desire to both understand and love that which I've hated most.I was absolutely obsessed with this story, and I'll definitely be purchasing the rest in the series.",

    "bookDescription": "Returning after a well-deserved leave, Archer Devereaux is given a tame assignment while the shipyard is finishing up repairs on his ship.Tame for anyone else, perhaps, but Archer seems to have a special kind of magnet that attracts trouble—this time from inside the Phlegraean Alliance. His diplomatic mission goes wrong quickly, and things get worse from there.As before, he manages to play the hand he is dealt skillfully, no matter how weak the cards he has been given. Assistance comes from unexpected and unlikely people, but for Archer, reprieves are only temporary. The war continues, and Archer Devereaux is in the thick of it.Although the book ends on a lighter note for him, how long can he expect things to remain on a positive track?Book 3 in this new military sci-fi thrill ride from #1 Amazon bestselling author John J. Spearman. It's perfect for fans of Rick Partlow, David Weber, and Jeffery H. Haskell!",

        "reviewDescription": "Mr. Spearman delivers yet another must-read page-turner! Once again I have interrupted a multi-volume mil sci-fi read to catch up with his action filled stories and so glad I did.The author plunges straight in to forwarding the story so you are best advised to read the earlier novels, though you can read this on its own as enough backstory is given throughout to keep you familiarised with the overall plot.I’ve read all this author’s work and thoroughly enjoyed them all. I say enjoy - the feeling I get when reading him is one of being wrapped up in warm blankets whilst the wind and rain rattle your windows. You’re safe and snug and warm… but there’s danger out there too, and all too close, so maybe wrap those blankets a little tighter.I’ve already pre-ordered book 4 in this series and strongly recommend you do too!",

    "bookDescription": "The winds of Fortune continue to try to drive Archer Devereaux onto the rocks of fate.Enemies abroad and incompetent leadership at home combine to make his life dangerously difficult. Luckily, when he’s able to put his hand on the tiller, he somehow manages to steer clear of total disaster.Having demonstrated a knack for achieving results no matter how long the odds, the navy calls on Archer for its most dangerous assignments as the war heats up. Even \"tame\" assignments turn deadly, as Archer's presence at diplomatic functions seems to guarantee disaster.His resilience and ability to overcome adversity are called upon repeatedly. He and his crew wreak havoc in enemy shipping lanes. Yet, despite his talent and ingenuity, he finds himself boxed in. The only way out is to take a gamble that, if they survive, it will expand the limit of scientific knowledge. And even if they manage to get through that, who knows what sort of trouble waits on the other side? The war has heated up. One man seems to be dragged into the center of the whirlwind time and again. It's a good thing for the Phlegraean Alliance that this man is Archer Devereaux.Book 2 in this new military sci-fi thrill ride from #1 Amazon bestselling author John J. Spearman. It's perfect for fans of Rick Partlow, David Weber, and Jeffery H. Haskell!",

        "reviewDescription": "I enjoyed both books in this series with a few small problems. This is Mr. Spearman's universe and he can create it as he wants. I will just say the only asteroid belt we have any real data on is much different than Mr. Spearman's belt. You could fly through the Sol system belt with your eyes closed and not worry much about hitting anything as the average distance between objects is over 600000 miles. You would worry a little because if you did hit something it would leave a mark.As others have the military discipline was a little lax but I can ignore that. It is a good story if you can ignore some of these faults. I recommend giving it a try.",

    "bookDescription": "They struck without warning. Now, survival depends on a man who’s never led.\nLieutenant Colonel Arthur Hanson was supposed to be an engineer, not a hero. Promoted to second-in-command aboard the CSV Margaret Thatcher, Arthur hoped for a quiet tour of duty—showing strength and keeping the peace.\nHe never expected a coordinated terrorist onslaught that would shatter the fleet and leave tens of thousands dead.\nWith the Thatcher crippled and reinforcements trapped behind political red tape, Arthur is thrust into command. Haunted by doubt but driven by duty, he must rally the broken survivors and strike back against a ruthless enemy who shows no mercy.\nBecause in the Orion Spur, freedom isn’t given. It’s fought for.\nAnd aboard a ship named after the Iron Lady herself, surrender is not an option.\nPerfect for fans of epic space battles, gritty heroes, and heart-pounding military science-fiction.",

Confronting minor skirmishes is a cakewalk compared to open war. \nBut freedom demands a price. \nWithout warning, coordinated insurgent strikes across the Spur leave the fleet limping on life support. The Margaret Thatcher herself narrowly escapes destruction—at an unspeakable cost. \nWith the fleet decimated and backup stalled behind political power plays, Colonel Hanson is forced into shoes he feels ill-qualified to fill.

        "reviewTitle": "Great sci fi military action",
        "reviewDescription": "As usual, Gibbs has crafted a great sci fi military story with depth and believable characters. Faith is a big factor, an integral part of the futuristic setting in which an authoritarian communist movement came to dominant earth, leaving religious and secular liberty-lovers alike fleeing to distant stars. Unfortunately, conflict follows. That said, the story is full of action, borrowing Naval tactics and procedure and extending it to space, and Gibbs has a good track record of writing believable combat. This book is hard to put down and the setting is among my favorites, familiar enough to connect with but with new wrinkles and tech that makes science fiction so engrossing.",

        "reviewDescription": "I am quite surprised by all the five star reviews. This is not a bad novel, but it definitely does not belong among the best ones out there, not even within the military SciFi genre. It is reasonably well written with a decent story and an attempt at including human challenges and complications. However, it stops at an attempt. The author struggles to make the  characters more than cardboard cutouts and I simply loose interest.The science fiction is also very simple, with no interesting or thought-provoking concepts and the world building is subpar. I finished the book, which I guess is something positive, but I won't read the sequel(s). I think the author may be churning out novels at a rate that diluted the quality.If you want to read good military SciFi, try The Lost Fleet series or the Honor Harrington series. There are many more that I would recommend over the Iron Fleet series.",

It has all the common tropes: unexpected command, against all odds, wisened mentor, inept political administration… despite that it executes all of them faithfully.It does get preachy. While there’s an expectation of understanding around Judeo-Christian beliefs, there’s also a nod to Islam in a few places. That ties in to the faith challenge trope and the thirst for revenge tropes.If religion bothers you, probably this one is a skip. It’s deeply interwoven in the prose.",

Captain Rohit Mishra, together with Staff Sergeant Dixon and Second Squad, accompany their new allies, the Lomolai, in a mission to find out what happened to Orlova. When they learn where she's gone, it strains credulity.What happens when a subset of Earth's population from times of antiquity is removed from our past, placed in a new star system, given advanced technology and allowed to develop on its own for thousands of years? Species One created project worlds for this purpose, but humans on Earth never conceived that they were the ones late to the party, and that humanity had already taken root elsewhere.Now, equipped with advanced tech from the Workshop and a sentient artificial consciousness, the historical past collides with a future no one could have imagined.",

        "reviewDescription": "The Pilgrim and the Wolf (Humanity’s Leap #3) by C.S. Garrand⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Ancient humans, hidden stars, and one impossible mission. Garrand’s universe just got wilder!CS Garrand has done it again! The Pilgrim and the Wolf is another pulse-pounding installment in one of my all-time favorite series — a sweeping space opera with the heart of The Expanse and the originality to stand firmly on its own. If you’ve been waiting for a sci-fi saga that juggles interstellar diplomacy, ancient human echoes, and big philosophical questions, this one’s got your launch codes.Overview:The node is unlocked. Irina Orlova has disappeared.With Earth reeling from a failed coup and its flagship Audacious stationed three star systems away, Captain Rohit Mishra and Second Squad join forces with their alien allies, the Lomolai, in pursuit of answers — answers that lead to revelations defying logic and history.As the crew uncovers a shocking truth — that humanity may not have originated solely on Earth, but flourished elsewhere, seeded by Species One — Garrand invites us to imagine a breakaway civilization equipped with technologies Earth scientists can barely fathom. Ancient humans, isolated for millennia, now re-emerging into the galactic fold.Armed with Workshop tech and a sentient AI companion, our protagonists face a collision of past and future that reshapes everything we thought we knew about the cosmos — and ourselves.Final thoughts:C.S. Garrand masterfully blends military sci-fi grit with sweeping metaphysical wonder. The characters continue to grow in depth and nuance, the stakes are raised without losing emotional intimacy, and the worldbuilding is breathtaking. I couldn’t turn the pages fast enough, and now I’m counting them down to Book 4.Happy reading 🚀🪐🐺📚",

        "reviewDescription": "What I disliked: Why do all these stories about Marines with none about Soldiers (Army guys)?  Many of the tasks undertaken are actually fulfilled by Soldiers, not Marines.  Also, they need a better \"second reader\" to ensure the thread stays true to the Marines and doesn't \"drift\" in Army jargon.  They are very different.What I liked: This collection provides very well-paced and clear-threaded reading.  The balance of action versus down-time is better than most.  Many such stories have the protagonists in constant conflict and such.  No military, or civilian, force could maintain the op-tempo.",

        "reviewDescription": "KID SAFE* - There is violence (space battles, some hand to hand fighting with space swords) - Alcohol use (they drink a beer, or visit a bar for 1 drink at a meeting and leave) - and Sex (the smell of her hair, and a kiss on the cheek (in one book? maybe two?))I've seen video games with far worse levels of exposure for kids.The sex question / filter has become a pet-peeve for me. If you are going to try to make your book \"safe for kids\" on the subject, then do what this book does and just don't go there.  Other series I've read try to keep the older readers (? I dunno their reasoning, I'm guessing) and make sex like it was told by a shy puritan preacher's wife or something.  Its not believable, its awkward, it adds no value to the story the way it is presented and the book would be better without it at all (the other book series, not this one; this one handles it right and just skips it)The characters are well written, believable and consistent.  The stories are good and it keeps up the pace so you keep reading.  The books don't delve into hard or fantasy physics to the point it becomes a technical manual - there is one inconsistency in the  \"twist drive\" and \"relative time\" that is explained away (later - they caught it after the fact and fixed it?) as being based on the questions of mass interacting - so believable (if you believe in the twist drive to start with!)Book 6 was a little thin - about 200 pages shorter than the other books, while being a small disappointment it was not that big of a deal (it left the overall story hanging, and most of the books come to conclusions on the main story)",

Your future self will thank you!This series is well thought out, magnificently crafted, with characters who continue to grow and develop (I'm on book 25) and you fall in love with them!  The crew of the Fafnir becomes your family, and you walk through their hardships and highlights with them.I am self proclaimed sci fi aficionado from the 1980's, with posters of \"Dune\" (the original), The NeverEnding Story, Krull, Buckaroo Banzai, and The Flight of the Navigator on the walls of my offices.  I have read all of Orson Scott Card, Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, Douglass Adams, William Gibson, Arthur Clarke, Phillip K. Dick, Ernest Cline, and now Chaney and Maggert..  These books become companions to all of those great moments of childish naivete where you believed in spaceships and adventures \"out there\".You will not be disappointed.  Incredible stories, book after book, after book, after book, after book, after book.....",

And, in a way, it fits.Listen, when I was a kid I heard about the Lensman series but I never came across it. I devoured all the Heinlein I could get my hands on but for some reason missed out on Doc Smith. Which is crazy, because Heinlein talked about him all the time.Anyway, as an adult I finally tracked down a copy of Triplanetary and was disappointed.  Kimball Kinnison and his Galactic Patrol were...boring.  I just couldn't get into it. I wanted to, but it was just flat.For some reason the name, \"Backyard Soaceship\" reminded me if Heinlein's \"Have Spacesuit, Will Travel\". I love that book, and have read it at least a half dozen times. So I gave it a shot. And I'm glad I did.Van Tudor's Peacekeepers are not the Lensmen.  They're generally independent, with a \"Sink or Swim\" mentality when it comes to newbies.  Once you're trained you're on your own.I had a lot of fun reading this. The writing is clever, with plenty of banter and humor.  Van has a strong sense of right and wrong which I appreciate. He's a good guy, who likes a good time but is still a gentleman.Don't expect a deep, meaningful plot here.  It's not Doestoevski. But it is fun and I plan on reading the whole series.Cheers!",

But look at how frequently the new books have come out!  It seems clear that that as time goes on, the authors spend less and less time on each one:  there are more and more repeating premises, and poorer and poorer continuity and editing.  (Wait, someone told you to do something and you did not do it...what were the consequences????).  (Mixing up names, occasionally referring to Van by name even when it is written in the first person, etc).Oh, and lots of facts seem right, but not all.  You can't be in geosynchronous orbit \"over\" a place unless that place is on the equator!  Maybe that is overly picky :-)",

        "reviewDescription": "“Space is both friendly and cruel. A mixed message, if you will.”-OMGOODNESS! I had so much fun reading this instalment, book-1 of Backyard Starship series, I couldn’t get enough of it! I stayed up burning the midnight oil as I kept turning the pages.The story starts with an unusual predicament that brings up an emotional crisis to the main character, which in itself reveals astonishing surprises, too hard to believe, occurrences that only happen in films and books. The reader immediately develops an attachment with the protagonist. From then on, the story launches into a spiral, rollercoaster ride, dizzy with unbelievable events.The vividness in descriptions takes our minds to travel within the settings of beautiful images, plunging the reader in the mindscapes of the characters, be them good or villains.The characters complement each other so well, they were destined to be together. Lovable and dotted with a charming personality, they are unique and adorable, even if they are not living beings. The main character is human, but the way the plot is written, Perry and Netty share the spotlight, because without them this story wouldn’t be half as entertaining and immersive as it is.There are hardcore events that left me flabbergasted, horrified, thought provoking moments in life, an existential question. But, Maggert and Chaney know how to compensate the plot and balance the storyline with a lot of dashes of humour, a witty dialogue that had me laughing constantly.Backyard Starship #1 is filled with unusual twists and plot points are designed to keep the reader on edge, moving from one gripping page to the next. A page turner well worth 5 Stars!",

        "reviewTitle": "A Martian Named Smith",
        "reviewDescription": "There is no question that Robert Anson Heinlein is one of the Fathers of Science Fiction.  There is also no question that STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND is his most famous work, having been called \"the most famous science fiction novel ever written.\"  Is it his best?  Perhaps not.  But it is a ground breaking classic, one that I enjoy reading again and again.STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND is the story of Valentine Michael Smith (Mike), a male born of human parents on the first Earth colony ship to Mars.  Literally born as the ship landed on Mars, Mike's parents and the rest of the crew died, and Mike was raised by Martians.  25 years later, a second Earth colony ship lands on Mars, and discovers Mike, the native inhabitants of Mars, and a host of unanswered questions.  Mike returns to Earth, and STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND is the detailed chronicle of his introduction to, interaction with, and transformation of human culture.STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND was Heinlein's first truly adult science fiction novel, and he took on some pretty heady topics.  Politics, religion, sex, equality, and the concept of a truly un-human culture (which happened to be superior), to name a few.  Heinlein wove these themes into STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, each of which contributed to his idealistic vision of a perfect world.He intermixed shock value, logic, and plain good storytelling to get his points across, and I think he did so quite wonderfully.1. Religion.  Heinlein was not an atheist, as some have claimed.  He did believe in a higher power; what he did not have any use for was organized religion.  He believed in faith.  If you had faith, true faith, then the trappings of religion were unnecessary and superfluous.  They just did not matter.  The Church of All Worlds in STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND was set up to show that no matter what the religious trapping were, it was faith that really mattered.  He also created a religion where happiness and self-belief were the main drivers, rather than fire, brimstone, and fear.  Makes great sense to me.2. Sex.  Contrary to popular belief, STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND did not promote promiscuity or free love.  What Heinlein did was to create a world where people were open about sex, where it was enjoyable and exciting, but with it came great responsibility.  In this world, sex wasn't hidden, secret, or naughty; rather it was honest and pure and fun.  People who could develop this utopian attitude became happier, healthier, less jealous, more caring, and, yes, more sexual.  Responsibility to partners, offspring, and an entire extended family became the norm.  In his own way, by exploring sexuality, Heinlein was exploring and redefining the meaning of family.  He was also trying to define sex as a miraculous union, and to show that humans should treat it as the miracle of bonding and \"growing closer\" that it is.3.  Equality.  Before the sexual revolution and equality for women, Heinlein clearly believed in equality of the sexes, equality of the races, equality of faiths...basically the equality of all humans.  Yes, he felt women should be treated with respect and reverence and be protected and nurtured because they gave birth and perpetuated the species, but he clearly believed that they were intelligent and capable.  He also believed that women had sexual needs equal to those of men and had the right to pursue those needs.4. Politics.  In STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, Heinlein clearly had little use for government, politics, or politicians.  He believed that government in general was a necessary evil, but preferred that it be kept small and out of his business.  He didn't care what it was based on or what guided it - astrology was the ridiculous example used in STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND - as long as it left him alone.  Works for me.  He also had little use for entitlements, and expected human beings to work for what they received.  Again, works for me.5. Un-Human, Superior Culture.  Heinlein did a remarkable and revolutionary thing when he created the Martian culture of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND.  The Martians of this novel are clearly not humanoids from another planet.  They do not think like humans, act like humans, look like humans, reproduce like human, live like humans, or do anything like we do here on the planet Earth.  There is nothing remotely recognizable about these Martians; they are completely alien.  We can't them, and they can't understand us.  They are older, more advanced, and can perceive the universe around them in ways that humans do not.  But humans can, if properly taught, learn some of the things that Martians do.  What a marvelous concept.In 1962 the original version of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND won the Hugo Award for the Best Science Fiction Novel of the Year.  After Heinlein's death in 1988, his wife Virginia discovered the original uncut manuscript and arranged to have it published in 1991.  It is interesting to read the two books side by side, to see the differences, and to compare them.  I enjoy both versions very much, and am still not sure which is my favorite.  Whatever version you choose, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND.  Whether you have read it before or not, whether you love it or not, you will find it to be an interesting and thought-provoking read.",

        "reviewTitle": "A strange book I don’t grok",
        "reviewDescription": "I have started to read this book directly after I had read “The Moon is a harsh Mistress” and after the first chapter, I almost stopped reading again. The first chapter starts promisingly enough, after a Mars expedition with only four couples, finding the fitting couples that contained all the required capabilities in themselves had been difficult enough, had failed, years later, another expedition is started, and this time, the flight takes much shorter. They find a young man there and bring him back, but how they treat him here, locked and no women allowed, for the first time really showed me how old Robert Heinlein’s books really are and here, for the first time, it was an annoyance. What would happen if a woman would visit him? We find out in the second chapter, and the answer is, basically, nothing.Then, for about 10% of the book, we get Jill, working in the hospital where the Man from Mars is kept, discussing with Ben, a journalist, about the implication of the Man from Mars. Once he owns the whole Mars, once he owns a majority of Lunar Enterprises. In any case, the government under the Secretary General cannot keep him alive. Then, finally, some action occurs: Ben tries to get the Man released, but fails miserably; Jill subsequently tries to prisonbreak with the Man. They escape to Ben’s place but the henchmen are not far away. They ring at the door, there is a confrontation and... it’s over. They go to another benefactor, Jubal, who keeps Jill and the Man hidden for rest of almost half of the book.There, Jubal thinks about how to help the Man, together with getting Ben back, while he tries to learn as much as possible about the Martian and Mars. Then, the henchmen appear again, ready to arrest everybody, and after the Martian makes the policemen disappear once more, Jubal eventually manages to bluff the Secretary General into calling back the second arresting team and agreeing to meet with the Man from Mars with him, Jubal, as the official delegate for the Martian. At the meeting, Jubal does what he can to make the Man’s live safe: He gives the Secretary General the mandate the manage the money of the Martian with the payment as much money as he sees fit.Having thus secured the Martian’s safety, the Martians keeps living at Jubal’s place and learning. They visit a service of the Fosterite church, where people gamble, visit the bar and have stories with women but when the archbishop wants to have one-to-one talk with the Martian, latter recognizes former’s evilness and discorporates him. Eventually, the Man from Mars has learned all he can at Jubal’s and he and Jill set out for the world. They join a circus troupe where the Martian performs a levitating trick with Jill, only it is not a trick, he really does so. But they are unsuccessful, the marks see right through it. They leave again, but not before they have listened to a snake charmer sermon about the Fosterites and before they make her a water brother. They next move to Las Vegas where Jill works in a show and the Martian as croupier and they elucidate naughty pictures. Thereafter, they go to San Francisco, where the Martian reads all the books about the various religions without grokking anything. They then visit a zoo where the Martian breaks out laughing as he, observing monkeys, finally groks people.They founded their own church, but it’s not a religion. The Martian had hereto shown some extraordinary capabilities, such as being able to enter a trance state where he could stay under water for hours, telekinesis and the ability to discorporate things or beings at will. Had the reader so far been wondering how he could do that, if the Old Ones on Mars has changed him somehow on Mars, now it become clear that this was not the case. Everybody can do it but, in order to facilitate such deeds, which were connected to Martian creed, one had to understand the Martian concepts, which one could only by firstly learning the Martian language. The Martian church was thus foremost a Martian language school. That was however not all it was. The Martian idea was that there was no God than God in everyone of us. All other religions were considered as truths, only that they were kind of hiding that God was each of us, and thus the creed was “Thou are God.” In the Martian church, also free love was practiced. We get hence a chapter where Ben was shocked by this and fled the church most hurriedly to report to Jubal, only to join it again the next chapter. And of course, we get Fosterites who try to start a persecution against their competitors.The end then also makes sense, but I don’t understand why. It was on one hand logical but on the other hand why was it necessary? This is thus not really a work of science fiction and but rather a theological treatise. I think it could have shortened somehow, then realized, that what the original editors thought as well. It was my third book I read from Robert Heinlein, Starship Troopers was a good concept which Joe Haldeman made into a good book, the Moon is a harsh Mistress was a quick read that kept me hooked, but considering, it is basically a story of the American struggle for independence, just on the Moon, and it will also be my last. There are other science fictions authors out there.",

I thought I knew this story - but as the years pass, perceptions change, and I've found more highlights to ponder this time around that I ever managed in earlier readings during the 70's and 80's.  Heinlein is always great, but it's fascinating to be able to compare the various editing techniques that were used on different editions; what some folks call boring, others see as insightful. Always more layers to uncover, that's the thing I love the best about Heinlein stories, no matter who they were written for, or when, or who edited them, and how. Marvelous stuff! :-)",

    "bookDescription": "After daring escapes and narrow victories, Thomas finds himself not only as the commander of Excalibur, but a symbol of hope to a fledgling resistance movement determined to challenge Morgana’s tyrannical rule.\nThere’s a high price to freedom.\nHidden among the stars, Thomas and his crew must transform from fugitives into fighters, striking where the enemy least expects while gathering strength for the battles to come. Their quest will take them to ancient worlds where forgotten alliances wait to be rekindled, and secrets of both magic and technology lie guarded by those who remember Arthur's golden age.\nAs Morgana's elite hunters close in, Thomas must embrace a destiny larger than he ever imagined. For in a conflict where every victory demands sacrifice, even legendary starships and courageous hearts may not be enough to challenge a dark fate.\nThe resistance rises. The stars bear witness.",

Nail-biting battles and sacrifice as the saga continues. It's time to delve into book 4 to see where Sir Dragon's mission to conquer evil leads him to next. I'm enjoying this series a great deal!",

        "reviewDescription": "This continuation of The Starship in the Stone is fast-paced and laced with tense conflict. While we have to believe that Excalibur and her team will survive, it sure is close. Death prowls in every chapter.Merlin’s AI tells Thomas, “Sometimes the hardest truths are the ones we can’t fix.” The heroes in this story have made choices in the past that haunt them, that stained their lives. Their challenge is to rise above those pasts and to live with honor, integrity and compassion, moving forward. Thomas models this, pausing to invite enemies to switch sides, to join the vision Arthur had generated.I appreciate the message and the characters, but the increased violence and destruction in the writing turns my gut, so I won’t be reading further in the series, should Forbes decide to continue.",

    "bookDescription": "The Marines are coming—but first, Arthur Hanson must survive long enough to see them arrive.\nTrapped on New Rostov with PFLOS terrorists controlling the planet, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Hanson has grown from a reluctant leader into the heart of a resistance movement. For weeks, he's bought time with blood and determination while reinforcements race across the void.\nFifty thousand Coalition Marines are inbound, but their success depends on perfect coordination. Arthur's resistance fighters must seize the main spaceport as the Marines assault and prevent PFLOS from turning the infrastructure into a killing field.\nAbove the planet, the Margaret Thatcher and the CDF fleet stand ready, but each battle reveals new depths to PFLOS capabilities and their League of Sol backers.\nArthur has come too far to fail the people counting on him, but leadership means knowing when to risk everything for those you're sworn to protect.\nThe liberation of New Rostov begins now.",

        "reviewDescription": "Finally some help is coming to New Rostov in the form of 50,000 marines to dislodge the PFLOS terrorists and League of Sol regulars from the planet. With the help of the ISF fleet, it may be enough. Things seem to be under control until it’s not and once again some out of the box tactics and strategy as well as some stretching of the rules by General Cohen are in order. Still on the planet, Colonel Hanson and his motley band of resistance fighters have an almost impossible mission to avoid disaster for the coming marines. There is no love loss between President Robbins and General Cohen. She is trying to find a politically feasible way to dump him and he is walking a very fine line between following orders and stretching them to avoid total disaster at New Rostov.  All of this is happening while all the characters are struggling to follow the rules of war against an opponent who is continually committing war crimes. Tons of action both in space and on the ground. Personally I found this book to be my favorite of the series so far.",

Daniel Gibbs pushes the Iron Fleet universe to a whole new level here. The tension on New Rostov feels real, and Lieutenant Colonel Hanson’s fight to keep his people alive is the kind of leadership arc that sticks with you. The blend of ground combat, resistance warfare, and massive fleet action hits the perfect balance.The stakes are huge, the pacing never drags, and the characters feel human even under extreme pressure. The battles above the planet, especially involving the Margaret Thatcher, are some of the best space-combat sequences Gibbs has written so far.If you enjoy stories about courage under fire, tight-knit teams, and the price of leadership, this one delivers. Easily one of the strongest entries in the series. Highly recommended.",

Not only is he prolific- I can't keep up- but his books are not as shallow as water on a plate. He even has the nerve to place God in the universe. You know, as the one who created and maintains it. But he's also respectful of other faiths beyond his own.And it's funny how Daniel Gibbs has created a universe for his stories too. There is an interconnectedness to it all, which is pretty cool. Actions in one series have consequences in others.You can be cynical and say that's a sales gimmick, but it doesn't matter with stories this dank.Dive in- the water is good in this part of space!",

    "bookDescription": "Everything old. . . is new again.With the Stillness and their Wulgor allies growing in power, Van and the Fist of Orion reach a crossroads of epic proportions. Who will lead the charge for justice—will it be Van and his trusted friends, or will the former GKU demand a seat at the table in a universe where nothing is ever settled, and old grudges don't die—they just linger?But old problems require new solutions, and Van sees the need for soldiers as an opportunity. From the growing ranks of the Shrikes, elite young leaders emerge, ready to answer the call when the Fist of Orion decides that sometimes, the best defense is a good offense.Teamed with the AnaDarko crew, the newest Peacemakers will begin using science as a tool—taking the fight to the Stillness wherever they are. But that means risk, and risk means conflict, and there's nothing messier than a family brawl when it comes to purging the stars of an ancient evil.Join Van and his crew as he learns that leading is harder than it looks, and sometimes, being true to yourself is the toughest fight of them all.",

    "bookDescription": "On a distant Earth colony, an orphaned survivor of an alien invasion discovers that the greatest world-ending dangers aren’t behind her.\nIt’s been eight years since an alien invasion drove a small surviving group of settlers to seek refuge in an underground shelter. Cut off from the rest of humanity, the ragtag band has maintained a narrowly functioning colony due to communal effort and salvage runs. Alex Archer has her own duties as a dog handler. While this off-world colony may be harsh, Ash, Alex’s black shepherd raised to sense threats, makes living in it a little nicer.\nBut the tenuous hide-and-seek with the monstrous species known as the Lankies is about to come to an end for Alex and her close-knit crew of soldiers, techs, and friends. When a salvage operation goes catastrophically wrong, the Lankies home in on the humans.\nWith hopes of a rescue long faded, all Alex has left is will—and the fear that there’s so much more to lose.",

It is slightly less than 300 pages, but the storyline is fast paced with relatable characters and huge planet stealing aliens.The plot is engaging, such that I just could not put the book down, getting lost in the fascinating world that realistically blends the characters lives into a compelling narrative of survival.I found it easy to relate to Alex and Ash (yes, the dog), vividly imagining life in this dystopian universe 100 years from now in the Scorpio worlds, 46 light years away.I’m a bookworm and chewing my way through this engaging page-turner and overall exciting read remains an enjoyable experience. Such an excellent balance between fantasy and pure sci-fi.  Deserves a 5-star rating for author’s skill as he weaves an amazing relatable experience.How do you survive on another planet, fighting giant aliens in a harsh and increasingly hostile environment?Well, that’s the story of course.Well worth the read!",

Unfortunately, this premise was discarded about a third or half way through, and what replaced it was incredibly boring. I gather that it’s a setup for a new series, but this was a terrible, clunky way to go about it.The main characters are engaging, the female protagonist is excellent (more on this in a second), the action is fast-paced and easy to imagine, the setting is well-described (also easy to visualize), and the pacing (first 1/3-1/2) is good.The interaction of the characters and setting helped develop both. Obstacles appeared and were overcome in a believable (consistent to world) way, at a pace that made for a good read. (Again, first section.)A subjective aside on pacing: There’s something to be said for a story that occasionally lets the reader rest, without so many lulls the pacing suffers.Regarding the female protagonist…I thought she was nicely balanced. Writers often struggle making a female character who is not a damsel, yet isn’t a ‘hardcore’ warrior-type. There’s a place for eachb, of course, but it’s also great to see an ‘average’ female character who is also strong and has agency in her own way.Also an issue for me is the ever-present use of passive voice. It’s appallingly bad. I found myself mentally correcting sentences over and over as I read. Not sure if he has a proofreader or editor (I didn’t check), but if so, they’re doing him a disservice by not pointing this out.Some of the overall weak points I’ve noticed are side characters that are *very* one-dimensional, character reactions I can’t always buy into, and dull interstitial scenes.General thoughts…I’ve read several of Marko Kilos’ books over the years, and have found them to be overall entertaining. His plots are fun, the pacing tends to move well, the action scenes are done well, the sci-fi elements work for me, and his main characters are generally interesting and relatable.I also know I can read without being subjected to gendered tropes, or those related to gratuitous sexual or physical violence. (Simply, if a reader wants a ‘safe’ book, his are a good bet.)",

        "reviewTitle": "would work better as a prequel",
        "reviewDescription": "The basic premise and the cast of characters are fascinating, but the plot line was weak, with little in the way of character development for the heroine. The affection of Logan and Alexis was never fleshed out, and  the one-night stand at the end only hints at what should have been a bigger part of the story telling. Descriptions of the expedition and return are drawn-out, as are those of life in the colony. At the end there is a deus ex machine ending. With some tightening and focus, this would make a good introduction to the next book in the series, either as part of it or as a stand-alone novella. There is a great story waiting to be told.",

        "reviewDescription": "4 stars/5 for Scorpio by Marko Kloos, book one of the Frontlines: Evolution seriesMy Kindle feels like a cemetery of unread books these days, so it seems like a bit of Christmas magic that I even started reading Scorpio. It was my Amazon Prime First Reads pick this month and, as the program so frequently does, introduced me to another author that I really enjoyed.Scorpio is engaging right from the start, dropping the reader into a salvage mission on a far away Earth colony overrun by a very large, very menacing alien species. I was never able to picture the aliens in my mind, but I could imagine the stark planet and the colonists who survived by holing up in an underground bunker for more than 8 years.Alexandra “Alex” Archer is a civilian who trains and leads Ash, a military dog with a nose capable of sensing approaching aliens. She accompanies the soldiers from their tiny garrison on salvage missions to destroyed terraforming stations and colonial outposts, helping to keep the salvagers safe as they dig through rubble looking for power and oxygen supplies and food rations that can prolong their survival in their increasingly hostile environment. There is action aplenty until Alex finds herself back on the home planet she doesn’t remember, with no family to welcome her.The novel moves a little slowly once the story moves from the Scorpio colony to Earth, reflecting Alex’s disorientation and isolation in a world where she is separated from her colonial friends and military family and sense of purpose. As a former military brat myself, I empathized with her as she struggled to adapt to her new life and can’t wait to see what the second novel has in store for her. It’s pre-ordered but is not expected to be published until January 2025!😩If you enjoy sci-fi or military storylines, pick up Scorpio and get to know Alex, Ash, and the rest of the colonists. It’s a great ride with perhaps even a peek at a possible future for humans in this big, wide universe.",

But at lot of \"wait a minute\" and \"what about?\"  stuff that makes it little hard to swallow. Still, if you have stuck with it through 14 books, you should read this one.  One of the best of this genre I think.",

The Admirals are gambling on a miracle; that he and his crew can repeat the success of his First Command by repairing vessels and sending them into battle. And maybe snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.\nFleet has been gathering damaged and deserted ships in a remote system on the edge of human-controlled space. Without transport, Jackson’s crew must travel on an obsolete military simulator, without shields or weapons. When they run into a Coven warship, it’s all Jackson can do to keep them alive as both ships crash-land on the planet.\nIn a running battle with cyborg warriors, Jackson must avoid alien patrols, build rudimentary weapons, and cobble together some type of ship that would see them escape the death planet and change the course of the war.\nHumanity’s war with the Coven is going badly.Fleet simply doesn’t have the ships or the manpower to counter the alien’s vast reserves, so Cole Jackson is hauled out of his self-imposed exile and ordered back to the front.

        "reviewDescription": "Well written addition to the series. It is a significant departure in setting from the first book, but manages to generally stick to the \"figure it out and get it done\" theme that's been established. There is a significant need to suspend disbelief around the final arc as the miracle juryrigged plot device seemed too unbelievable to take seriously. Regardless, it was still an entertaining read and the characters fairly interesting. I think a return to the setting similar to the first book would be the strongest direction for the author to take.",

        "reviewTitle": "Weak, and deeply flawed",
        "reviewDescription": "The story in this series has promise, but the author seems to take a perverted delight in hampering the protagonists.  They never seem to have anything go their way, until a last minute miracle saves them, albeit at the cost of several lives and much equipment.  This scenario is repeated endlessly and became tiresome and predictable.  Also, numerous scientific errors are present (a two minute Duck Duck Go search could have easily eliminated these unforced errors).  Like all modern sci-fi authors, Mr. Simon references “evolution” as a fact, despite it being a mathematic impossibility.  He describes the color and character of light from behind a FTL ship which is ludicrous, as light could not catch a vehicle traveling that fast.  Descriptions of warships with a bridge located prominently on the front of the ship are nonsensical, as that important control center would be buried deeply in the most heavily shielded portion of the ship.  On page 103, the author essentially stole the idea of how James Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru on Star Trek.  Early in the book he stated the missiles weighed 4 kilotons, but later claimed 4 tons.  Bone repair in humans is accomplished by osteoblasts, not osteoclasts.  Ammunition for firearms is contained in a magazine, NOT a clip (unless they were firing a Garand M1).  And lastly, how were the engineers able to fabricate tools and weapons when no electrical power was available?  As to the writing itself, Mr. Simon seems to not know what an adverb is, or when it should be used (to modify verbs).  He also endlessly uses “there’s” (there IS, which is singular) to describe plural people, places, things, situations, etc.  All the grammatical errors place this series well below top-tier writing, and the scientific errors are unacceptable to anyone with even a modicum of physics knowledge.  It would take very little effort, and a competent editor, to elevate this series to a reasonably believable, and more enjoyable, level.",

    "bookDescription": "Thomas never expected to find Excalibur stuck beneath a Welsh lake. He never asked to be a hero. And he certainly never imagined standing between a tyrant and the fate of a galaxy.\nDestiny doesn’t wait for permission.\nFrom the mystical world of Avalyeth, Thomas’ journey will lead him and his growing crew into the heart of enemy territory, the halls of ancient dragons, and the path of knights who remember a time when hope still burned bright. Hunted by the Draconite and haunted by the past, they’ll need to risk everything to outmaneuver and overcome those who would see them destroyed.\nAs new alliances form and old rivalries re-ignite, Thomas must prove he’s more than just the captain of a legendary starship—he must become the leader others believe him to be.\nEven if he still isn’t sure he believes it himself.",

        "reviewDescription": "Over decades of SF reading I have come to an almost ironclad rule. Military SF need to be written by military vets. An outstanding exception is David Weber, but the large majority of civilians who attempt military SF fall short.My second rule is that I do NOT read a new (to me) author bio before reading the book. Come in cold without expectations and see what happens.It was obvious within a few chapters that Crudge could talk the talk. And by mid-book you could tell he walked the walk.Military SF can be anywhere, with almost any plot, in any universe. If the author doesn't understand good order and discipline, the book will be 2nd rate at best. If the author doesn't understand how military structures function, the book will be a flop.THIS IS A GOOD READ!",

To prevail, the CDF must find out why Boutin did what he did.Jared Dirac is the only human who can provide answers -- a superhuman hybrid, created from Boutin's DNA, Jared's brain should be able to access Boutin's electronic memories. But when the memory transplant appears to fail, Jared is given to the Ghost Brigades.At first, Jared is a perfect soldier, but as Boutin's memories slowly surface, Jared begins to intuit the reason's for Boutin's betrayal. As Jared desperately hunts for his \"father,\" he must also come to grips with his own choices. Time is running out: The alliance is preparing its offensive, and some of them plan worse things than humanity's mere military defeat…Old Man's War Series #1 Old Man’s War #2 The Ghost Brigades #3 The Last Colony #4 Zoe’s Tale #5 The Human Division #6 The End of All Things  Short fiction: “After the Coup” Other Tor Books The Android’s Dream Agent to the Stars Your Hate Mail Will Be Graded Fuzzy Nation Redshirts Lock In The Collapsing Empire (forthcoming)At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

        "reviewDescription": "Series Info/Source: This is the second book in the Old Man's War series.  I borrowed this from Kindle Unlimited on audiobook.Thoughts: I enjoyed this but not quite as much as the first book in the series.  I think the wonder of this world and the humor in the first book just really blew me away.  I did enjoy still getting to see Jane, but this story focused  more on a Ghost Brigade soldier (Jared) created from the consciousness of traitor to humanity, Charles Boutin.I continued to enjoy this world and really enjoyed learning more about The Ghost Brigades.  We meet a mostly new set of characters in this book, although Jane and Harry are in and out of the story some.  I enjoyed Jared as a character but not as much as I enjoyed Perry and crew in the first book.We do get a much broader story here about the CDF versus three other alien races.  We also get exposed to some intriguing questions about the CDF and their motives when it comes to human interactions with alien races.  Additionally, this book focuses a lot on The Ghost Brigades themselves and what it really means to be human.I didn't think this was as funny as \"Old Man's War\" but there is some humor throughout.  I listened to this on audiobook and really enjoyed the audiobook narration.  I would recommend listening to this on audiobook if you enjoy audiobooks.My Summary (4/5):  Overall I liked this.  I didn't think there was as much humor in this book and didn't enjoy the characters in this second book quite as much.  However, I did enjoy learning more about The Ghost Brigades and delving deeper in to this world.  I also really enjoyed the broadened storyline around the CDF and the three alien races joining forces against humanity.  I look forward to reading \"The Lost Colony\" soon.  I would recommend to those who enjoy science fiction with some intriguing space travel, aliens, and a look into what it means to be human.",

I'd only be repeating that info here. What I want you to know is that Scalzi is a genius Writer (with a capital \"W\"). \"Writer\" seems so pedestrian when referring to Scalzi. Better to describe him as \"Novelist\" or \"Storyteller\" or \"Wordmonger\" (maybe not that last one). Or \"Craftsman.\" His stories are clever and brilliant, all unique, humorous and dramatic, believable...yet out there. If you want to get your mind off your troubles, or the troubles of the world, or you want to let go of your disbeliefs willingly (like a movie), or you need some frivolity, or you like plot twists and turns, or you think you can guess what's coming next or later in a story (like I do) but you get it totally wrong, or you just want a tale that blows your mind, read one of John Scalzi's books.

        "reviewTitle": "The Space Battles are Cool",
        "reviewDescription": "Daniel Gibbs's Iron Fleet series excels in its depiction of space warfare, which remains genuinely compelling throughout. However, certain ideological elements undermined my engagement with the narrative.The pervasive religious nationalism struck me as anachronistic for an interstellar civilization. While Gibbs attempts to present a generalized rather than denominationally specific faith system, the notion that such particularistic, terrestrially-bound ideology would persist as a dominant force among advanced spacefaring societies strains credibility. From a theological perspective, one might expect more universalist or cosmologically-informed spiritual frameworks to emerge in such a context.Similarly, the Cold War-era capitalism versus communism framework feels historically myopic. Contemporary geopolitical realities reveal a more complex picture, particularly China's hybrid model of market economics within centralized governance. Against this backdrop, the premise of a resurgent Soviet-style communist empire expanding into space reads as dated political science fiction rather than plausible extrapolation.These conceptual limitations aside, readers seeking well-executed space combat sequences will find much to appreciate in the Iron Fleet series. The tactical elements are thoughtfully rendered, even if the broader ideological and moralistic architecture of Gibbs's universe lacks sophistication.",

I'd like to say he was wrong (and he has substantially exceeded that 3-book arc) but most of the time I don't think he is.So it's still a very good book but after 6 books in the arc I'm just done.  It isn't the fault of the writer, I just don't have the patience or care enough to bother reading more of these books.  I find myself tiring of what increasingly feels like filler and I'm increasingly irritated when an author tells me what the hero/heroine sees in the eyes of another (especially in an alien which should have different visible tells).I find myself skipping significant portions of the books which are supposedly displaying the incredible insights and even good portions of action sequences because I'm not finding them new or interesting.I will likely read more from this very skilled writer - but not in this story arc.",

        "reviewDescription": "I’ve enjoyed the story so far. The books have been well written and edited. The story fast paced.The only problem I have with the story is the story’s timeline. I think that the timeline in the story is too fast paced. It seems like the characters in the story don’t really have any time to eat, sleep and visit the lavatory. It’s like one ever after the other happens is so short a period that the characters can’t catch a breath. The main character in the story just goes bulldozing from one event after another and relying on hope to see it through. There does not seem to be any effort to study the enemy and come up with counters and think the situation through before acting.",

        "reviewDescription": "I'm normally a Hard Science Fiction reader but once and a while I enjoy a good action story.  Star Scrapper was full of action.  The excitement kept me reading and I will watch for a deal on the next book in the series.  Some of the futuristic Science could have used  more of a description of how it came about or even a little of how it worked but if you are just reading v for the fantasy adventure Star Scrapper is your book.",

        "reviewDescription": "This book has everything I’ve come to expect from a Chaney partnership: great action, strong characters and cool universe. There were also a surprising number of laughs.I wasn’t sure what to expect from this new series but as soon as I started it, I was hooked. Hank is a good lead character but I found myself drawn to Ned the AI buddy. His struggle is interesting and the dynamic between the two was great.I can’t wait for the next one and hope there are many more to come. If you’ve been looking for your next great scifi read, this is it.",

        "reviewDescription": "I’m so into these characters now! Wow! Really great writing by this author. The characters are developed really well throughout this book. I can only imagine how that will expand. It was truly heartwarming, and I gotta say, honorable how Grimm pulled that boat and it’s team together. They became a real fighting machine. When a crew acts in the he way that these do then you know their leader is a good one, who inspires them to be their best, to be the best the Navy and the Marines the military has to offer.The other portion of the book is sickening in its realism of disgusting, deceitful, dishonest, stab you in the back cowardly and traitorous characters. The things human beings are capable of inflicting upon others in the name of power, money, country or religion is just pathetic. But it’s not fiction in our real world, as we all know, and this book gives a heavy dose of evil; believable fiction and so disgusting and heartbreaking for that true fact of the semblance of possibilities. 😢The other thing this author is really good at is battle scenes and there’s multiples of them—against different ships, locations, marines battles, and we even get battles from the enemies perspective. So not a dull moment.I’m so excited I found this series & I was eager to start as I’ve read this author before and knew I wouldn’t be disappointed. Hoo yah!",

        "reviewTitle": "Honor Harrington Meets James T. Kirk",
        "reviewDescription": "There’s a lot of very good military sci-fi series out there. The genre has several niches; ground combat, space combat, political space opera, etc. I tend to favor ground combat books, but I am a big David Weber (Honor Harrington) fan, so I decided to jump in with Jeffery Haskell’s Against All Odds, the first book of the Grimm’s War series.The first chapter is a gut punch. You start out with a young, up-and-coming James T. Kirk-esque officer. In a brilliant feat of writing, Haskell introduces an almost insurmountable flaw to the character in the most dramatic fashion possible. I was hooked from that point on.This isn’t a hero that can do no wrong. His career ends up in the proverbial toilet. He’s given a ship, but it’s a far cry from the flagship of the fleet. In fact, it is an old tiny destroyer, one without its primary drive. Its captain is dead and its crew has been idling on a backwater world, watching their careers pass them by. So much for my initial thoughts of James Kirk.Haskell brings in a layer of politics, weaves in an intriguing mystery, and provides his protagonist with a chance to achieve some level of redemption…not just for himself, but for his crew.The Grimm’s War series now has eclipsed Honor Harrington for me. Don’t get me wrong, I love David Weber’s work, but there is a lot of overburden with his brand universe building. That’s not bad, but it does kill the pace and let’s face it, military sci-fi guys love action and battle. Haskell swiftly navigates past things that might slow the plot down, blazing a fast-paced and exciting trail through the stars. He’s produced a series that transcends universe building and focuses on some well-rounded, very human characters.For fans waiting for their next Weber fix, I highly recommend you hop aboard the USS Interceptor and buckle in tight, it’s destined to be a bumpy ride.",

While not officially charged, he is crucified by the media and the result is that his career is going nowhere.  He’s reassigned to command an old inoperable space destroyer which he manages thru excellent command decisions to resurrect and break up a human trafficking operation and stop an invasion.

    "bookDescription": "“I realized that I wasn't going to get any sleep (Just one more page... Just one more page…) I'm not just reading words on a page, I'm there… A hell of a ride.” NetGalley reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Humanity is on the brink of annihilation. Only one man can turn the tide.For centuries, we explored the stars and settled new worlds. But a mysterious alien threat emerged, launching devastating attacks and seizing entire star systems. Every fifty years they come, silent and relentless, before disappearing again into the dark. And as they close in on humanity’s home worlds, one more defeat could mean total extinction.Captain Jim Garrett joined the navy to fight back. But when a delicate mission ends in madness and mutiny, Garrett takes the blame and his career is left in ruins.Now, the only thing he commands is a construction site. The CNS Surprise is an experimental warship, half built in the dockyards of Midway Station. Garrett knows the ship inside out, but the navy brass would never let him take the helm, let alone lead her in battle.But when the aliens strike early, with unexpected ferocity, it’s clear that every ship in the fleet will be needed. And the Surprise could be the only hope of slowing the enemy onslaught.Garrett is thrust into command for the first time, launching straight into combat. He must unite a maverick crew and master new technologies, as he leads a desperate counterstrike that will decide mankind’s future.Off Midway Station is a military SF adventure of high-stakes space warfare, nail-biting action, and characters you would gladly follow into battle. A monumental journey of courage, innovation, and the relentless pursuit of survival, it’s perfect for fans of Jack Campbell, David Weber, and Marko Kloos.See why readers love Marc Alan Edelheit’s epic stories of battle and adventure:“Cutting edge… A wild ride that ended in truly epic fashion… I absolutely enjoyed it from start to finish… AMAZING.” FanFiAddict ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐“Wow!… fast-paced… action packed adventure! Wild, exciting, gripping!” Goodreads reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐“Holy cow!… awesome… A page turner… I stayed up way too late reading this.” Goodreads reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐“Absolutely epic… gripping… I thoroughly recommend this!” Goodreads reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐“Your adrenaline will be pumping…Your blood pressure will rise… you will find hard to put down.” NetGalley reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐“Edelheit belongs amongst the elite … It is difficult to put the book down… By the end, it is nearly impossible… You need to pick up a copy!” Goodreads reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐“Outstanding! I couldn't put it down. Intense action.” Goodreads reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐“A must-read… clear your calendar and hold on for the ride!” Goodreads reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",

        "reviewDescription": "Off Midway starts off with a tense action scene and then cools down for a considerable period. First novels in a series can be slow because of the world building involved. Off Midway though suffers from a lot of detail that adds nothing. For example, the leader of a group of starfighters goes through systems checks. Edelheit describes in excruciating detail every check the officer goes through. This leads to paragraphs when a sentence would have sufficed. Off Midway also suffers from repetitive loops of dialogue and narrative. Edelheit needs to edit his work to pare down these loops. The novel does pick up toward the end proving that Edelheit is capable of producing suspenseful action. My advice would be to skip over the minutae and get to the good part. I'm willing to read the next book in the series to see where it goes.",

Hopefully, the \"Guardians of the Dark\" series will have a book #2 soon.The main character suffered a major hit to his spaceforce career when he was forced to make a difficult decision during a battle, which was later vindicated; however, he became blackballed from future command opportunities.  Being a highly competent professional, he proved outstanding in an alternative career path, but his dream to command a ship never died.  During a sneak attack by humanity's enemy, Captain Garrett was in the right place, at the right time to assume command of a new ship under construction.  From this moment, he proves he was not only at the right place at the right time but also the perfect captain for the ship.This book ends as a cliffhanger and ready for book #2.  I first read this as a borrowed book and immediately purchased it upon finishing it (the first time).  Hopefully, Marc Edelheit doesn't keep me hanging for book #2.",

        "reviewDescription": "Midway Station is a vast shipyard and fleet staging area, our Captain Garrett is stationed here as a \"Job\" Captain, meaning the Job is the construction and commissioning of a new warship. His latest project is known as a Mothership. Designed to carry both military and science personnel, while operating deep in hostile territory, and she's nearing completion.The action begins on the first page, and while it tapers off enough to catch a breath, it doesn't let up for long. There's a point where I realized that I wasn't going to get any sleep (just one more page... just one more page).As a sailor in the USN, and an Airedale, there was plenty to love here too. The Mothership has her own recently assigned air (space?) contingent, and they will be needing to earn their keep (even though the ship isn't really complete). When describing the Mothership's interior, the hangar spaces, the sights and sounds of the flight deck, I'm not just reading words on a page... I'm there. Watching flight ops. Watching the Marine Detachment jog. Bumping my shoulder on a frame of the ship as I move by someone in the passageway.  Procedures too... there's a lot of checklists when working on aircraft, there was some déjà vu moments that brought me back to my younger days.This is some great military science fiction. If you are a fan of the genre, then there's something here for you. It's a hell of a ride.",

Sorry if I missed this info in the read.  This story reminds me of  the Grimm series of space navy stuff.  Which I can't put down.",

        "reviewTitle": "Interesting start to a series",
        "reviewDescription": "Not too bad. Some interesting ideas and plot lines here. The biggest thing that turned me off was that it was just too wordy. I think the author could significantly pare down the word content and make things flow a lot better. Using repeated adjectives that essentially describe the same thing, characters continually reflecting on the situation, as though to sum up the last few pages of description. Paragraphs describing the gravity of the mood in the room. Even the characters often speak in duplicate, saying two sentences that are essentially the same, as though the author couldn’t decide which to use. I actually started hating the word ‘and’ about halfway through the book. One of the old writing adages is ‘show, don’t tell’. The author seems to want to both show and tell the same things repeatedly.Again, not a bad tale but the writing style was a bit off-putting for me personally. It kept jarring me out of the story and preventing any sort of immersion. Hopefully the author will see this as constructive feedback for future books.",

        "reviewDescription": "Decent read, space battle novels are my thing and the story was entertaining enough. The author gets a bit excessively descriptive at times but fortunately its not overwhelming and relatively easy to skip ahead to the important stuff if you don't care what colour the eyebrows are on a character. Its not quite as technical as other books of this genre so if you like your SciFi with a bit less Sci and more Fi this mostly fits the bill. My only con for this story is that the ending was somewhat unfulfilling. I know this is intended to be a book series so the story will continue, but other similar book series I've read at least provide a satisfactory ending for each book, this book didn't really have an ending per se, just a basic pause point. Its more \"part 1\" than \"book 1\". But I will read the book 2 when it comes out.",

Planning.And those plans will collide with the rising stars of an empire based on justice and action. Out in the deep black, Abel Tudor and his crew will fight to prove that command isn't given, it's earned—and their parents chose well, giving them the helm to a warship that could change history with one fateful journey.But they have allies who are proven veterans of a galaxy gone mad with violence. Van, Torina, and the crew aren’t retiring—they’re reloading, and with the Fafnir and crew come something the Stillness have never faced before.Van Tudor, the commander of it all. He’s older, wiser, and unwavering in his commitment to justice, but now, he’s got decades of experience in the trenches with his friends, family, and allies who share his vision for freedom and peace—at any cost.Along the way, Van, Abel, and their teams will meet old friends, new enemies, and discover that space isn't just crowded—It can be lethal.Especially for the young, no matter who their parents are.",

Van and his team need to come up with a way to fight them because they are fighting dirty.  Also, their children are not off limits.This is a well crafted story that keeps you interested from start to finish.  The introduction of new characters, Van’s, Funboy’s, Iky’s and Mandaville’s kids is excellent.  Keep the stories coming.",

    "bookDescription": "Mack Banes is the first face you want to see in the last place you'd want to be…\nWreck Jumpers are highly specialized soldiers trained for search and rescue deep behind enemy lines. They are the special forces operators sent in when things have already gone from bad to worse.\nMalcolm \"Mack\" Baines and his Recovery Team are the best of the best. When a Special Orbital Assault Regiment School nestled inside an asteroid belt suddenly goes dark, Mack and his team of Wreck Jumpers are tasked with putting eyes on the target.\nTheir mission: recon the site and turn the comms back on.\nWhat they find is a base in chaos with survivors desperately holding out for rescue amid oceans of floating rock and an unknown enemy determined to make the Wreck Jumpers part of a growing body count.\nJust one wrong move could mean a crushing end in the cold vacuum of space and the death of everyone relying on Mack and his operators…\nBut that's why Mack became a Wreck Jumper in the first place.",

        "reviewDescription": "Wreck Jumpers.If you pick this up and have no idea of the Galaxy Edge universe, this is a great teaser to get ALL of them.  This book was modeled after some of the most unsung heroes who do not want the accolades, who do not want the fame.  ParaRescue(PR). Most military knows now that Doc, is ..DOC.  Doc must be protected at all costs, however, PR's bring a whole new level of kick ass to the field.  When the US Special Forces calls for medivac, PR comes in and kicks more ass than the SF kids, to get the wounded out and safe.Why is this important?  Why do I put an emphasis on this level of effort?  Ask a military friend you know.  PR are the guys who JUMP INTO the areas that are so hot the SF teams need an evac, they are the fearless, only GOD will stop them from succeeding at whatever mission is in front of them.  Black holes?  bah, trivial crap.  The enlisted are the key drivers of the REC-teams.  You want something done?  Give it to the First Sargent and tell him the teams can have the rest of the day off when finished.  You won't get the order completed before it's done. There is a constant in any military, the Senior Enlisted are the backbone, and the officers, if they are smart will listen to them.  Remember that as you read forward.I thought this would be a \"Oh? crap broke? let's go get it and save folks and do some heroic stuff\" type of read, maybe in the first few paragraphs but it takes that and expands it into the Galaxy Edge universe, it shows the growth and mentoring of the enlisted characters in intense situations and allows you to put a real voice into your head when you read the lines.  There is the new guy who has to earn his place and keep it, the old salt running the team, who feels like he has a PhD in warfighting. and the Officers, who have all built something that this type of team must have.  Implicit trust in the team, each other, and doing the right thing, even if it will cause problems.Standard military, cover your ass is one thing, but in this Universe it carries to a whole new level.I apply voices to each character as I read, a voice, an image and a manner of body language.  Fresher, the new guy has this just out of puberty voice in my head that still breaks when he gets excited.  Top (Mack) has a voice similar to a 80's Scifi TV show Admiral, and Creeper?  His voice is one of the pilots off that same series.  yeah, corny as hell but.. it's how I read.The story is enveloping, enticing and absolutely spot on for this Universe and fits into it like a glove.  For those of you reading this, and not familiar, it is a perfect intro to the Universe and a great lead into Dark Ops, Night Ops and the skills and absolute top tier abilities to go save those and prevent the enemy access to the good stuff.  If you enjoy Scifi, this is a Universe that Jason and Nick and many others over at Wargate spend all their time giving us the ability to escape from the day to day BS we deal with.If you have read into this Universe, gear up, get your get set and your L-comm set for a few hours of seamless matching and some hair raising rescues and plots.This book has some really awesome plot slides and twists, and will keep you in it  cover to cover.  Get into Wreck Jumpers and get to reading.",

From Isaac Asimov to Roger Zelazny, it's been my favorite genre since I started reading in grade school, where I found Madeleine L'Engle \"A Wrinkle in Time\".Today, J. N. Chaney & his co-authors of a variety of scifi series, take up a lot of my reading time.It couldn't be better spent. But for my money, The Backyard Starship is the best of Chaney's work. Even after 22 novels, there is nothing stale about the characters or the story arc.If you only read 1 science fiction series this year, choose The Backyard Starship. I plan to re-read the entire series this coming winter.Get to know Van, Torina, Perry, Netty, Netty-P, Icky, Rob, Gabby, Funboy and The Fafnir, start with book #1 and sooner than you think , you'll have read them all!",

This book had a good story even though it had some grammatical mistakes.The one disappointment was that for a large part of the book the rest of the crew were not involved. This story seemed to focus mainly on Jason while the rest just seemed to be bit players.After reading this book I couldn’t help but get the feeling that OF is coming to the end. This mainly had to do with the story revisiting the past and not really presenting anything new that would move the series forward.",

Now they must fight to keep their newfound freedom.The Republic Senate will never tolerate rebellion. An invasion fleet is gathering—vast enough to crush every secessionist world. But to reach the Rim, it must stretch out its supply lines across the stars. This weakness is the rebels’ only hope.Captain Caleb Hawthorne and a handful of warships stand against the Republic Navy’s might. Outnumbered and outgunned, they must strike fast and strike hard, or face annihilation when the fleet reaches their homes.Meanwhile, deep in the Core, Rebecca Guzman risks everything to uncover the Republic’s darkest secrets. What she finds could alter the course of the war—and shake the Republic to its very heart.Fires of Freedom is the explosive second novel of the Secession War series, where the rebellion burns brighter—and the cost of liberty grows ever higher.",

Abandoned for thousands of years after being hammered by the founder of the republic.  A republic with is kind of a cross of Darth Vaders minions and Nazi storm troopers. With a sprinkling of either SS or Gestapo.Really hope this series doesn't last too long. Sorry but the unrelenting stress and pressure isn't fun and drags the story into dark places. A few rays of hope now would be nice.",

    "bookDescription": "I just wanted to tell my neighbor to shut up.My name is Jake Taylor, and I write romance novels. Well, I used to, anyway, before the camping trip where the Grays snatched me. I’m not sure what they wanted with me, but before they could sell me off, I was rescued by a group of mercenaries.Unfortunately, I couldn’t pay for a flight back to Earth. It’s not part of the Galactic Consortium, so there aren’t a lot of flights going there, and most of them are by races that are stealing the Earth’s resources and fomenting discord so that we never get invited into the Consortium.But when I'm offered a chance to join the mercenary company that rescued me, I see my chance to not only make it back to Earth, but also to kick those alien assholes off planet once and for all.They think Earth is their plaything, but I’m going to show them just how wrong they are!For fans of Reluctant Emissary, Psyker Marine, Drone Ensign, and other military LitRPG science fiction.",

        "reviewDescription": "On occasion, I find a book that radiates that it was fun to write.  This is one such.  It was also a hoot to read.  It’s basically a level-up game where the main character starts with an accident or other incident and finds themselves embroiled in a situation where they have to start from the bottom and work their way up to some abilities and save themselves.  This one isn’t different on that level, but clearly, humor is thrown in along the way.  It’s a quick read and easy to submerge oneself in.  There is a good balance between showing the various stats and having the characters discuss them.  The one drawback is common to all such level-up tales.  The oft-referred-to level-up chart appears regularly whenever the character looks at their stats.  Not so much an issue in the text as the reader can see the entire list in one glance and see the improvements, but when confronted in audio, one must listen to a near-endless drone of stats.  The stats in this text are not endless, not displayed at every turn, and are discussed between the characters, so I suspect they will translate better to audio.  Whether you’re an eager reader of these game-like tales or an infrequent visitor to this genre, I recommend this one to all.  You’ll enjoy it from start to finish.",

This book hits the mark for being \"crunchy\" enough with the stat blocks, but not overwhelming. Chris built a world where the crunchy bits actually make sense and don't feel like they're bolted on to \"make it LitRPG\".It's a bit of a slow start as we're introduced to Jack's new life and he has to level up from romantasy author to mercenary. The struggle is real and Jack has to learn things the hard way. By the end, I was interested to see where this is going. Jack has grown and he's got one huge goal motivating him - kick out the aliens on Earth that created this whole mess for him!",

The story line is very entertaining, and the main character who's a \"novelist\" certainly has a very large learning curve as he's now tossed into the deep end of what he'd thought was just Science Fiction genre.

    "bookDescription": "WINNER OF THE JAMES HERBERT AWARD FOR HORROR WRITING “The Troop scared the hell out of me, and I couldn’t put it down. This is old-school horror at its best.” —Stephen KingOnce every year, Scoutmaster Tim Riggs leads a troop of boys into the Canadian wilderness for a weekend camping trip—a tradition as comforting and reliable as a good ghost story around a roaring bonfire. But when an unexpected intruder stumbles upon their campsite—shockingly thin, disturbingly pale, and voraciously hungry—Tim and the boys are exposed to something far more frightening than any tale of terror. The human carrier of a bioengineered nightmare. A horror that spreads faster than fear. A harrowing struggle for survival with no escape from the elements, the infected…or one another.  Part Lord of the Flies, part 28 Days Later—and all-consuming—this tightly written, edge-of-your-seat thriller takes you deep into the heart of darkness, where fear feeds on sanity…and terror hungers for more.",

        "reviewDescription": "Nick Cutter’s The Troop is one of the most viscerally disturbing novels I’ve ever read, and I say that as someone who is not easily rattled. I usually pride myself on having a strong stomach when it comes to horror fiction, but the grotesque imagery in this book genuinely made my skin crawl. Cutter’s descriptions are so vivid, so unapologetically graphic, that I found myself wincing more than once. This isn’t horror that tiptoes around the macabre; it dives in headfirst and drags you with it.What makes The Troop more than just a body horror freak show, however, is the character development. Each of the boys at the center of the story is carefully crafted and complex. As the horrifying events unfold, their personalities are peeled back, layer by layer, sometimes subtly, sometimes violently. Revealing the best and worst of human nature under extreme pressure.You don’t just witness their fear, you feel it. You don’t just observe their unraveling, you understand it. The psychological depth Cutter gives each character adds an emotional weight that elevates the story far above the typical survival horror genre. Their transformations are not only believable but also tragically inevitable, which makes the ending all the more impactful.The Troop is raw, relentless, and utterly unforgettable. It’s a masterclass in body horror, but even more impressively, it’s a study in character and the fragility of morality when pushed to its limits.",

        "reviewDescription": "As a part-time online book reviewer and fulltime editor, I am constantly on the search for talented new faces in the literature world. After hearing about two up-and-coming novels, I am Murphy's Law by C. E. Scott and \"The Troop\" by Nick Cutter, I decided to check them out, and I instantly understood what all the buzz was about.\"The Troop\" is classic pulp and gore horror at its very finest. Take an isolated island, five incoherent boy scouts and their somewhat inapt leader, a stranger who suddenly appears out of nowhere with a deadly parasite consuming his body, and you have yourself an unmerciful tale that takes hold of your fear and doesn't let go\"The Troop\" doesn't read like a book from a new author at all. It was more like a novel written by a seasoned veteran in the field, and I was taken back to the first time I read Carrie as I raced through its pages. I swear, if one of the boys possessed psychic abilities, I would have bet my salary that it was written by Stephen King under a pseudonym. But nope, no Richard Bachman here.The bioengineered tapeworm in this novel is the perfect killing machine. It not only wastes away a person in a matter of hours, but it also alters their thinking process, making the person make rash and tactless decisions (which leads the characters into a horrible downward spiral). It also spreads like no other contagion, through blood, saliva, other bodily fluids, and coughing, and if I was on the island, I would not touch anything that had even been near one of the contaminated. I would have taken my chances and swam through the icy waters surrounding the island, just to be as far away from it as I could.What makes the situation even worse is that after the boys' leadership is all but gone, it is up to the younger counterparts to govern themselves while fighting against the contagion at the same time (this is where the\" Lord of the Flies\" reference comes into play). At first, you view these boys as the typical stereotypes, the nerd, the bully, the outcast, etc., but some seriously dark psychological issues that weren't known to each other emerge, and the hierarchy completely unravels. What were once the weak become the powerful, and it sets forth some really epic battles within their crew. It is amazing what these adolescents can actually do to each other, and it is particularly frightening to what acts one of the boys is capable of. (I won't give any spoilers. You'll find out for yourself.)All in all, it was an excellent book, and if you are a fan of horror, you will love it. I enjoyed the way he used official documents and other written articles to change the story's pace and give insight to where the parasite originated and what was happening around the island during the characters' peril. I do have a few qualms, but they are hardly negative by any means. Cutter's writing style is immaculate. He has a very keen sense for description, whether when dealing with emotions, the scenery, or the gore, itself, and his prose is majestic in a way, like what you find in British literature. There were times when I would get lost in his prose and have to reread sections because I lost cognition of what was happening. The middle section of the book was somewhat slow, and there was possibly too much backstory. Some people might gripe about this, but I enjoy seeing what makes a character tick. I also viewed some of the character's decision making as unrealistic, but who can say what people will do under such stressful and horrific situations.Be warned, this novel is very graphic in nature, and Cutter describes the horror in ways that make it seem so real. \"The Troop\" is not for the faint of heart. It is very gory, and like other reviewers have written, there are instances of animal abuse. But it's fiction, people. It didn't really happen, and if you don't like reading about it, don't read it and then give it a bad review. This is a horror novel, after all. It's meant to be disgusting and bring out your emotions, and with that being said, if that's what you're looking for, you've come to the right place.I normally don't write reviews outside of my website, but I couldn't resist after reading these novels. I have placed Doctor Sleep: A Novel, The Troop, and I am Murphy's Law as the top horror reads for 2014. If you're looking for a great read from either one of the big boys on the block or one of the new kids on the block, you can't go wrong with any of the three.",

        "reviewTitle": "The Troop: horror from within",
        "reviewDescription": "The Troop is a really disgusting book. That is a compliment. There were places where I wanted to stop reading, for it to just go away, but I couldn't help myself: I had to know what was going to happen.The plot begins with simple ingenuity: a troop of boy scouts are trapped on an island where something is going terribly wrong and they must battle an unspeakable horror. And then it is ratcheted up: one of the scouts is a budding sadistic psychopath. Think Lord of the Flies meets The Thing meets World War Z meets I Am Legend meets Alien meets Hot Twink Boy Scout Measuring Contest or Scouting for Wood, with a reference to Anne of Green Gables to push it over the top.The combination is delicious, tense and, as I said, disgusting. The plight of the scouts is horrible and rendered in purple but precise prose that reveals author Nick Cutter's day job as literary writer Craig Davidson (though who gets to decide that definition is beyond me). There are pages - particularly concerning a monkey and a kitten in my case - that made me want to shield my eyes. There will be different pages for other people with individual sensibilities: there are lots of horrors and gollops of gore to choose from.There is a thread of homoeroticism that runs throughout The Troop that is just more than subliminal. It is, alas, also confused, as if Cutter was - unbelievably considering what he does splay on the pages - afraid to go there. The only expressed sexuality is arousal by extreme sadism and the phallic nature of the worms give a disturbing contradiction to what Cutter seems to be trying to express. He is far more successful in drawing a direct but subtle line between the callousness of governments and power and the mind of a nascent serial killer. It all comes to fruition with a masterfully done macguffin built into the very structure that is emotionally devastating.But most intriguing is Cutter's repeated theory that there is an innocence in childhood that allows one to withstand terror because one can believe in the unbelievable. He posits that as we reach adulthood we are no longer able to cope with horror or tragedy because we no longer have the ability to imagine it could happen.It is an idea that resonates, gives a melancholy tinge and speaks to Cutter's intentions with what is already a very efficient and great genre novel, and makes the scouts' descent into adulthood and horror all the more affecting and brutal. Any horror fan child, or adult, will enjoy The Troop.Full review at: http://drewrowsome.blogspot.ca/2015/09/the-troop.html",

        "reviewTitle": "Old school horror at its finest",
        "reviewDescription": "The scouts of Troop 52 and their Scoutmaster head off to Falstaff Island for a few days of camping with no idea of the horror to come. An emaciated man stumbles into camp begging to be fed, But they don’t realise he is actually very sick or how much of a risk he poses. Who will survive?This is a disturbing read, the body horror is grotesque and nauseating. The breakdown in what is right and wrong, the societal integrity we all think we would uphold, is so well done. It is shocking how the characters adapt to the normality of a world with no rules and discover how quickly they will forsake moral standards to survive.The use of newspaper articles, court transcripts and interviews throughout the book give a glimpse of what’s to come in the story, I liked that. This was Lord of the flies on steroids, the horror is squirming, repulsive and determined, the story is sinister and stomach churning and it is best read when not eating! An old school horror, I loved it, 5 stars",

And one way or another—it all ends here.From the fields of Iowa to deepest space, the final conflict will unfold with only one thing certain: Not everyone will survive, but Van will give his last breath to make certain that when future generations speak his name, they will always remember one fact.Until the end, he gave it all for justice, no matter the cost.",

To save his life, the ship’s own biomatter must replace his failing cells.\nNow , Noah is different. Stronger, faster… and there’s a voice in his head.\nThe voice of the ship itself, and its name is Kayan.\nWith no way to return home, Noah must adapt and rebuild his life in this unfamiliar corner of the universe. And as he does, he discovers a looming threat in the far reaches of space, growing in power, and set on capturing Noah and his ship.\nWorse still, this new enemy knows about Earth. . . and it has big plans.",

The POV character, supposedly a top Earth astronaut, comes across as rather immature a lot of the time when I would like to see more quiet confidence and self-esteem, but he's basically a good guy, especially as opposed to the villains we meet.

        "reviewDescription": "I'm guessing the author had some inspiration from the TV show \"Farscape\" as it follows a similar Astronaut-lost-in-space theme. That's not to say \"Homeworld Lost\" isn't original, because it is, with plenty of interesting twists and turns along the way. I'm particularly fascinated by Kayan. She(?) is a living ship, like Moya from the aforementioned \"Farscape,\" but the author has developed the concept into a unique element of the narrative, with virtually unlimited potential to continue developing as both a character in the story as well as a plot device. I look forward to learning more about her in future books.While I have enjoyed other books by this author, I'm a bit excited by this one, because this novel has the potential to become a massive franchise. While the major plot points could be wrapped up in just one more novel if the author chooses to cut it short, alternatively, it has the chops to be developed into an expanded-universe with numerous books to expand the overall tale. I look forward to reading the next one, and hope more are to come.",

        "reviewTitle": "Good, But Doesn't Match Other Series",
        "reviewDescription": "In comparison to the works of a number of authors out there, this would be a four-star book.  However, Mr. Chaney and his various collaborators have so many good series out there (Renegade Stars, Last Hunter, and perhaps one of his best - Backyard Starship and the Peacemaker series) that it's hard not to judge this series in light of those that preceded it.So many of his other series grabbed me early in the book.  I quickly became invested in the main character and knew well before I finished the book that I would be buying the next one in the series.  Not so much with this book.  The overall plot was interesting, but I spend quite a bit of the book wondering if I wanted to continue the series.  I didn't quickly become immersed in this book like I have in the first book of the author's other series, and I certainly didn't become immersed in the main character.Here's a man who's supposed to be one of the very best, considering the mission he was chosen for - smart, talented, and one would assume, trustworthy and a number of other characteristics.  He didn't sell those attributes very well.  He came across as a smart-alecky 15-year-old kid.  He can't even figure out that his many earth-based phrases and colloquialisms don't register with aliens and he's wasting everyone's time by continuing to use (and over-use) them.  You just feel like you want to shake him and tell him to grow up!However, there were enough interesting moments that I have purchased the 2nd book in the series.  I will see how much the character grows.One comment:  I look at the star rating like school grades - 5=A, 4=B, 3=C, 2=D, 1=F.  My rating of 3 starts says I think it's an average book.  I have troubles with people who will rate a book 3 stars but talk about how much they didn't like it and won't continue the series.  That's a 1-star review, or perhaps 2.I like these authors, and the book got a lot of 5-star reviews, so if it looks interesting, give it a try.  You may like it better than I did (and I did buy the next book, so I think the series has some hope).",

There were also some pretty big holes in the story and parts where the author suddenly took a different direction without rewriting the earlier part to make it all mesh.  Like the embarrassing and dangerous parasite problem that suddenly became not a parasite problem but seed animals needing to be dropped off on a planet.Not sure if I will read any more.  Maybe.  The underlying concept was good and I do like living ship stories.  This one had some similarities to the Honor books but without all the teen angst.",

With a ragtag assembly of Marines and Army Rangers by his side, known by the callsign Nomad, he charges into battle against insurmountable odds. The mission? Win, whatever the cost.

But just when he thinks he has a handle on the situation, the enemy—unpredictable and ruthless—flips the script and launches a fierce counteroffensive.Will his team rise to the challenge, or will they be overwhelmed in a fight for survival? The stakes couldn't be higherBook 2 of a series where only the strongest will prevail and follow the indomitable spirit of a warrior in Battlespace Nomad, from debut author Will Crudge. Readers of Rick Partlow and David Weber will be captivated by this military science fiction tale of triumph over adversity, and of heroes over evil.",

    "bookDescription": "A Warhammer 40,000 NovelBelisarius Cawl is the greatest mind of his age, and he has a plan to open up the Attilan Gap to allow safe passage through the Great Rift. In order to complete his work, he travels to a necron tomb world. In the process, he attracts the attention of something even more dangerous than ancient xenos…READ IT BECAUSEBelisarius Cawl continues to be one of the most important figures in the 41st Millennium as he attempts to solve the greatest problem facing the Imperium – allowing safe passage through the Cicatrix Maledictum. He squares off against ancient necrons and the forces of Chaos in his audacious attempt to do the impossible.THE STORYFor years, Belisarius Cawl has nurtured an audacious plan to stabilise the Attilan Gap sufficiently that the Imperium might open a stable route into Imperium Nihilus. With the primarch Roboute Guilliman having crossed the Great Rift, and now isolated on the far side, time is running out.Before Cawl can perfect his latest great work, he requires one last element: control codes preserved on an ancient necron world trapped on the event horizon of a black hole. Realising that even he cannot do this alone, Cawl recruits help from across the Adeptus Mechanicus. Yet as victory nears, malign intelligences have taken note of the archmagos, and Cawl is about to discover it is unwise indeed to provoke the interest of Vashtorr the Arkifane…Written by Guy Haley.",

        "reviewDescription": "Another great tale featuring our ever so egotistical and accomplished Belisarius cawl, however this time we get to witness him through the eyes of historitor Solana an adept sent by Lord Guilliman to record (spy) on Cawls progress with the Necron Pylons.For him to achieve this, he needs valuable untouched tech set on a planet that is being consumed by a black hole and thus weird time shenanigans and adventure abound.Guy Haley is clearly in his element when it comes to Cawl, the character is so magnetic and fun to read that you can tell the author is having a blast with him.There are other plot lines involving one of which is an iron warrior warband who believe they have shackled one of the most interesting villains to come out of gamesworkshop in recent years and he is called Vashtor. I would arguably say this character was just as fascinating to read as Cawl and I'm very much looking forward to seeing where his storyline goes.The story is not without faults, the other plotline featuring returning space marine Felix set on the wolfspear planet of Ulviem was completely forgettable and dull mainly because I just wanted to stay with Cawl and his adventure, proof really with how engrossing a storyline Cawls was.Overall a great Cawl story that concludes with Cawls' typical theatrical flourish.",

All the characters are good and well fleshed out, even the bad guys. You feel the losses from your favorites too. I am buying each of these in paperback as they come out, so yeah I really like this series and you will as well. I hope the next half we get to explore more of the ruin and its history and get the next half going for HVT Sorceror . Can't wait!",

        "reviewDescription": "Some readers of previous books in this series have voiced some objection to Talker's preoccupation with coffee and his lengthy prose recounting its virtues, ways of preparation, etc. Fear not in Sua Sponte. Coffee, while present, because Talker, takes the sideline to all the Ranger action you could ever ask for. Rapid delivery of violence and some carefully considered magic save the Rangers' bacon in this new addition to the Forgotten Ruin series.",

        "reviewDescription": "I really couldn't believe how bad this book was! Cut out the thousands of coffee references and constantly repeating Ranger Smash and half the book is gone. Out of thousands of books I've read, this is in the bottom five! The entire book was either beyond formulaic and predictable to the extreme or ridiculously repetitive. The authors started out with a pretty good idea and then made sure each book was worse than the one before. The exact same reason I quit reading their other sci-fi series. They couldn't pull off and ending so they blatantly plagiarized Star Wars. The Sargent Thor books are so far a step in the right direction but im sure given time that they will successfully destroy that story line too. Nothing but sad Ranger Porn and public masturbation.",

But the enemy has a plan of it's own and it starts with the psychic abilities of Talker. I really enjoyed this entry as one of the largest actions so far unfolds. For both sides it is for everything and no spell, under handed deal with dark forces, high explosive and high velocity tool is off the table. There are acts of heroism and some characters fall but to no reader who has reached this far in the series the rangers get it done. I'm looking forward to seeing where the series goes from here what with the reinforcements and the next opponent in the north.",

        "reviewDescription": "Another superlative offering!Seek the Galaxy is the third book in Gillies’ Return to the Galaxy series. I give it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5! I’ve read them all (twice so far), and they are all so good!  It has been many years since I’ve read a series in which the excitement of the story AND the superior quality of the writing is not just maintained but improves with each new title.In Seek the Galaxy, we are again kept informed of Velal’s trials and tribulations. She searches ahead of the Ranid’s course into the Orion arm, hoping to protect or perhaps transplant Saret colonists. Ewan and Jera struggle for control of the effort to prepare earth to defend against the expected Ranid attack.Gillies didn’t start writing fiction until just over two years ago. Yet his handling of this complex story is incredible; he manages the story from multiple perspectives and locations. What I find so unusual is that he doesn’t just take ideas from past great writers and mix them in a different order. Instead he has new ideas, new concepts, new ways of handling various pieces of the story. Are there some ideas I have seen before? Yes, it IS a space opera, after all— but he gives them his own spin.In Seek the Galaxy, we are again kept informed of Velal’s trials and tribulations. She searches ahead of the Ranid’s course into the Orion arm, hoping to protect or perhaps transplant Saret colonists. Ewan and Jera struggle for control of the effort to prepare earth to defend against the expected Ranid attack.I believe the digital version of these titles has been developed by an expert IT professional. They are well organized; I’ve had no problems identifying the source, location, and time of each section of the story. Each section is linked in the Contents, not just by chapter, making Gillies’ books exceptionally easy to navigate. All appear to be professionally edited as well. Frankly, I’ve seldom found this level of professionalism by independents in digital publishing at all, let alone by relatively new authors.Gillies is a wonderful writer. His initial works certainly compare favorably with the greats of science fiction—including Heinlein, Asimov, and McCaffrey. (And Gillies is still publishing!) If you love science fiction, you’ll love Seek the Galaxy. Book 4, Explore the Galaxy, is scheduled to be released October 6, 2025.",

The Ranid have found the Wild Colonies, and they intend to burn them clean. Cradle Colony is under assault. The Ranid unleash wave after wave of dreadnoughts, Marines and nuclear bombardment. Yet Suna Fidam refuses to yield, leading one of the most audacious last stands in Saret naval history.Beneath the devastation, four trapped lieutenants race to survive a collapsing world, hunted by Ranid killers and betrayed by one of their own. Their struggle becomes the spark of something larger, proof that even in annihilation, the brave fight back.Across the Orion Arm, Velal gathers a massive relief fleet while Vidas pushes into uncharted space to search for allies among lost Wild Colonies.On Earth, Ewan Scott faces his most dangerous enemy yet. Human intelligence agencies would rather kill him than believe the truth about the coming war.Brutal, desperate and epic in scale, Fight for the Galaxy is perfect for fans of Scott Bartlett, John Scalzi, Craig Alanson and Glynn Stewart.",

        "reviewDescription": "Fight for the Galaxy continues to showcase BA Gillies’ ability to present this very complex story in a coherent way, beginning with a battle between Saret and Ranid fleets. Battles continue throughout, literally and politically. Themes of loyalty vs betrayal and cowardice vs. bravery are skillfully woven throughout. There are successes but also heartbreaking losses.Earth’s secret agencies and top military commanders become more worried, fearful and aggressive towards SUS and its people. Some countries work together in their desires to control SUS, making serious attempts to steal its secret technology. Some  prove willing to torture and kill SUS scientists and leaders in their attempts to gain this information.The Orion Federation works to support the people and legitimate leaders on colonies originally planted by the Saret. Plans are made to move willing populations to new planets in order to hide them from the Ranid. Saret Admiral Velal and her fleet continue to look for Saret colonies and fight the Ranid in fierce battles. In both Federations, the themes of bravery vs cowardice and loyalty vs betrayal continue. We are left with a cliffhanger (which I still don’t like!), but once again, Gillies has left us a bit of the beginning of Book 6 Stand for the Galaxy, which helps a little.I’ve purchased, read and loved all five volumes in this series so far (Some more than once!) I was excited to receive an early free ARC for Book 5 Fight for the Galaxy, and this review reflects my honest opinion of it. I continue to love each book as the drama and excitement builds, anticipating the final volume, Book 6 Stand for the Galaxy.Gillies has hit all the usual features of a classic space opera, but added his own unique twist, updating the classic space opera. It has the usual complex storylines, many characters with varying beliefs, goals, emotions, moral codes, etc., in different cultures, multiple locations, with exceptionally long timelines.The format serves to keep the reader informed of the next point of view, speaker, location and often the timing and/or what is happening. I especially appreciate this feature, as it helps me easily keep track of who, what, where, when, and why. The editing and overall formatting is again superb; I noted no typos or misspelled words.  I am in awe at Gillies’ imagination, coupled with his ability to keep this very complicated series in his mind and give it to us in an understandable form.If you like classic space operas, you will love his updated version, including this volume, Fight for the Galaxy. I certainly do! and give it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. I recommend starting this series from the beginning, with Book 1 Return to the Galaxy.Booklover11-23-2025",

        "reviewDescription": "Awesomely awesome..Unless you don't like cliffhanger endings, which the author loves... but not the reader ^^I have been hooked on this series from the first book.If you like Starship Troopers, Undying Mercenaries, Expeditionary Forces, and empire building then this is for you. And when I mean empire building, it's nicely done. Just missing the Terran guys sending the terrorists/alphabet a 3-ton meteor to keep them quiet.I would note as well as the author does a VERY compelling job of mixing at least 3 different timelines with different POV. It's building a final confrontation that will be memorable. Usually authors crash down into some non-sensical time-travel and discontinuity traits, but for this series, I would say it's well built.Battles are very well choreographed,  the pacing is fast, and 5 seconds after opening the book, you will already be screaming, \"Where's the rest? how will it end?\"I would recommend the author to get some Kevlar-reinforced gloves to write way faster!",

    "bookDescription": "What would you do if you were given a second chance?Titus Briggs is an Earth Defense soldier, a grunt, a decorated war hero—it's all he's ever known. So when a career-ending injury leaves him lying in a hospital bed, missing both legs, he struggles to accept his new reality. He can no longer walk, which means he can no longer fight.That is, until a mysterious colonel arrives and offers Titus the opportunity to step into a new kind of war, a new kind of fight.To become a new kind of soldier.Mobile Combat Suits—MOCOMS—represent the next stage in human warfare. They enable soldiers to fight like never before. Stronger. Faster. Bristling with weaponry. Far more lethal.And even a broken veteran like Titus can operate one… if he can find the heart, grit, and determination needed to pass selection.Now, with the end of humanity upon him, Titus must become the Able-Bodied Soldier.",

        "reviewDescription": "I have found that any book with writers Chaney and Anspach is one to read. 'Able Bodied Soldier' is one of those. War, no matter where it's fought, leaves a permanent emotional and, in many cases, permanent physical scars.I have seen how technological advances have given a few the ability to return to a somewhat normal life. A wonderful organization called the 'Wounded Warrior Project'* is a non-profit tax deductible group that is instrumental in helping those men and women who gave all they could in the real world.In this book, 'Able Bodied Soldier', the reader can feel some of the emotional pain when the main character, Titus Briggs, experiences what he fears will be the end of his life as a soldier. Since he was pulled from high school, Briggs has been in the forefront fighting the invading aliens. He is now a military leader in the thick of battling hostiles for the security of the planet. Former Beatle John Lennon wrote in one of his famous songs, 'Beautiful Boy', - \"Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans...\". Today, for Titus Briggs, life happens.This is a great military style story that brings all of the tension you'd expect. Couple the excellent writing with the narration by one of the very best in the business, R.C. Bray, and for me, the perfect book. - Mr.Bill*woundedwarriorproject.org",

I will follow this series.My only quibbles are the periodic grammar mistakes that are like potholes and break your train of thought. Words like \"none\" and \"every\" (and a couple dozen others) are SINGULAR no matter how many plural clauses you hang on them. A sentence like \"None of the soldiers were wearing their helmet\" is flat wrong. None WAS wearing HIS helmet (unless they had one common helmet they took turns wearing). When the gender is unknown or mixed, classic grammar specifies the masculine. If that is too un-PC for you, you have to use the cumbersome \"his or her\" or reword the sentence to something like \"None of the soldiers wore a helmet.\"Nevertheless, I'm eager for Book 2.",

        "reviewDescription": "I had previously read something by Chaney, something scifi, so I keep seeing his books in my recommendations.What I had a problem with is that this book is a little scifi and a whole lot of war. Now, I am a senior citizen, so it takes something to make me squeamish. This book is violent, but not gory. But it is full of military jargon and abbreviations. But many were undefined. So many  it knocked down from 5 ⭐'s to 3. Now I tried using the Internet to search for these definitions, but often the results were either non military or not found. Take AA for example. In a general context it is usually an abbreviation for Alcoholics Anonymous. In the context here, I figured it was something to do with aviation and/or armaments. 🤔 The point being a reader shouldn't have to stop reading to try to figure these things out!I also have a general pet peeve regarding the books I read - or two. First, is typos. Because any published book should have a professional editor to find these errors (and we all make them). Second is grammar. Actually, this is my biggest pet peeve. I grew up reading books. Not just any books, but the classics. Several by Charles Dickens, others like Black Beauty, and so many more; too many to mention. Reading taught me more about grammar than I ever was taught in school. Correct grammar just \"sounds\" right to me because I was exposed to it in a fundamental way. It wasn't so much about learning rules, as learning it intuitively through reading. So when I read \"I and my friends,\" for example, it's like fingernails on a chalkboard. I can occasionally overlook it if it's appropriate for the speaker, but it's still grating. I will say, that there are fewer grammatical errors with Chaney than some others I have read.In conclusion to my review and rant, if an author is writing about a specialized topic, it is absolutely necessary to define and explain to the reader who is not an expert in that arena. But this really is a good book, and I plan to read the sequel.",

Operating on the very edge of Imperial doctrine, he investigates conspiracies that pit him against aliens, heretics, daemons, and even fellow Inquisitors.READ IT BECAUSEThis is every single one of Dan Abnett's Eisenhorn stories collected together for the first time in one mammoth tome. This chronicles the epic saga of Eisenhorn as he clashes time and time again with the daemon Cherubael and dabbles with darker powers to mete out the brutal judgements he believes necessary.DESCRIPTIONFrom investigating strange murders to facing off against a vast interstellar organisation, Gregor Eisenhorn is an Inquisitor who is willing to pursue dubious means to guarantee success. Follow his journey as he becomes entangled in the fate of the alien text known as the Necroteuch, and draws the ire of the Imperium to him as he becomes embroiled in cat and mouse games and double-crossing with powerful friends and foes.CONTENTSRegia Occulta - a short story by Dan AbnettXenos - a novel by Dan AbnettMissing in Action - a short story by Dan AbnettMalleus - a novel by Dan AbnettBackcloth for a Crown Additional - a short story by Dan AbnettHereticus - a novel by Dan AbnettThe Keeler Image - a short story by Dan AbnettThe Magos - a novel by Dan Abnett",

        "reviewDescription": "Eisenhorn takes place in the Warhammer 40k universe and if you haven't read a book in this particular genre then you could do worse than start here.  Eisenhorn describes the life and times of Gregor Eisenhorn an Imperial Inquisitor.  The Inquisition is what you might expect given the naming; it's an organization that ruthlessly seeks out and destroys the 40k version of heretics and other things deemed improper by the Imperium of Man (the human side of things in this universe).  Those improper things encompass a wide range, but primarily the Inquisition seeks out and destroys those forces dedicated to spreading Chaos.  Chaos in the Warhammer 40k universe is a malevolent force that derives from the Warp and manifests itself physically in the form of daemons and those who utilize the Warp energies to further the agenda of Chaos.  That agenda is nothing less than the destruction of the universe and the order it represents.That's the basis for what Gregor Eisenhorn fights against and it's a constant struggle for members of the Inquisition against Chaos as Chaos is able to corrupt so easily and members of the Inquisition are so frequently exposed to sources of Chaos. The Eisenhorn stories are part action adventure and part mystery and Abnett does a good job of pacing things and keeping the reader on their toes.  The various stories in the book describe Eisenhorn's wide ranging adventures in his fight against Chaos and the temptations that he avoids and those that he falls prey to. Eisenhorn employs a large coterie of characters as part of his retinue so the book is not solely focused on him, though it tends to revolve around him.The weak point of the book takes place in the last third as there is a time shift that disconnects the first two books from the last and leaves the reader feeling somewhat adrift as many of the familiarities of the first two books are swept away.  The last book also loses some of the breakneck pacing of the first two and drags a bit.  Other than that the Omnibus itself is overall quite entertaining.  While Abnett has not really written any more Eisenhorn stories he continues in this vein in Ravenor.  The Ravenor character is derived from these Eisenhorn stories and while not required it's probably best to read this set of stories before reading Ravenor.",

        "reviewDescription": "This compilation was the 'last chance' read for dan abnett in my book, after what I considered contrived or overt insertion of coincidences to introduce plot items or devices/resolutions in First and Only and Fell Cargo.  I particularly felt first and only was entirely too contrived in the introduction of elements of gaunt's background, each as needed for the plot.  Maybe he was limited in space or had strict outlines there, but in any event....this series had none of those flaws.  First-person narrative read well, and usually quickly, with no sense of contrived coincidences just to move the plot along, and few if any of the cliche plot turns that I disliked in the books i mentioned above.  Furthermore, Abnett shows his tremendous ability to describe enviroments, worlds, cities, through language.  When he describes a Hive-city, a small village, a trans-alpine railway, you feel like you are seeing it.Another great strength of this story, particularly Hereticus, is the development of his ability to write very competent antagonists.  A major defect in much sci-fi, BL and not, is the use of cardboard-cutout antagonists, who leave you wondering how they ever rose to their position in the first place.  The major antagonist in this trilogy, Pontius Glaw, shows early signs of the extreme competence without omnipotence that some villains from his later Ravenor series show.Edit - 4th re-read, 08.2008 - Having read everything else by Abnett, and gained a lot of familiarity with W40k in general, I would like to offer that this is a great trilogy.One thing that caught my eye this time was an aspect of Ravenor that was apparently dropped in the Ravenor novels - His Lord Seer eldar that he referred to in the last part of this trilogy.  The implication was that Ravenor was subservient or at the very least allied with the Eldar, something Abnett seems to have just dropped in the follow-up series.",

I'm just a mom who would normally turn my nose at something Warhammer, but was convinced to try and enjoy the complex and rich lore by a family member. I couldn't put the Eisenhorn omnibus down, cover to cover I read the entire thing in less than a week, and then read it again. This and Space Wolves were fantastic gateways into the Warhammer universe. I've since bought several more Warhammer book series and am devouring them. This particular work was excellent and Abnett is a great writer, he avoided the sloppy, lazy, low vocabulary writing I've seen littering most modern \"literature\". The pace is excellent, the surprises and character developments were great, the story arcs were well done. I really really loved this series and look forward to the Ravenor books.",

        "reviewDescription": "Eisenhorn: The Omnibus is an outstanding read for anyone who enjoys Warhammer 40,000 lore or gripping science fiction in general. The stories are rich and immersive, with Gregor Eisenhorn as a central character who feels complex, intelligent, and morally compelling. The blend of detective-style mystery with the dark, expansive Warhammer setting keeps you hooked from start to finish.I was particularly impressed by the depth of the world-building. The various factions, technologies, and political intrigues feel detailed and believable, and the author does a great job of balancing action with character development. Each book in the omnibus flows seamlessly into the next, making it easy to binge-read while still appreciating the nuances of the story.Overall, this is one of the best Warhammer novels I have read. The writing is engaging, the plot is well-paced, and it brings the universe to life in a way that both long-time fans and newcomers can enjoy. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a captivating and intelligent sci-fi experience.",

A war like no other.\nWhen the research starship Galileo vanishes without a trace, the powers-that-be are quick to bury the incident, eager to prevent escalating tensions that could lead to war. As a former POW, Soren refuses to give the ship up for lost.\nHis daughter is one of the missing.\nTaking matters into his own hands, Soren starts pulling strings and calling in favors, determined to launch a clandestine mission to bring Galileo home. When an old friend offers him a ship for the operation, he expects a rusty relic headed for the scrapyard.\nInstead, he's given the Wraith—an unfinished, experimental starship with plenty of potential and just as many problems. A marvel of engineering…if his crew can keep her running.\nThey’d better.\nBecause Galileo’s disappearance is just the beginning. War is coming to the Federation from the most unlikely of places.\nAnd Soren may be the only one who can stop it.",

        "reviewDescription": "I was a bit hesitant to start into this book, having read many reviewers stating how much different this book is from Ender's Game.  It's true, Speaker is its own beast; a distinctly different tone, setting, pace and plot, but it has the same basic premise and spirit. The significant difference, in my mind, is the level of maturity. Whereas Ender's Game was fast paced, and written in a manner that anyone of practically any age can enjoy, Speaker is geared more towards a mature reader, and is written with greater emotional and philosophical depth.On its own, Speaker could have been a great novel, but I think Card's decision to write Ender as a full novel gives Speaker even more depth and meaning. If the only thing you really enjoyed from Ender was the battles, then there's not much need to read this book - give yourself a few years, reread Ender, and give yourself a chance to appreciate the human interactions of Ender, because to me that was the greatest strength of Ender as well as Speaker. Once you fully appreciate Ender, there's no way you won't appreciate and love this novel as well.Speaker is a great story, with fantastic characters that jumped off the page for me, and it was highly satisfying to see Ender as a man. However, I did feel that the novel gave short shrift to its early characters and that some of the philosophy that is delved into in the next book, Xenocide, could have been brought forward and fleshed out here. I think that perhaps an additional 50-100 pages would have been sufficient to bring more life and meaning to the characters before Ender arrives.Despite this, Speaker is one of the best novels that I've ever read. It is masterfully written, and conceived. I'm sure that even though this book does give a feeling of completion in term of plot resolution at the end, you will want more, and the next two novels in the series will be a necessary read for everyone.",

        "reviewDescription": "This review is for the Kindle edition ebook.This is the follow up to \"Ender's Game\". It is the story of how Ender Wiggin learned to cooperate with alien life, rather than destroy it. In the first book, Ender learns to play a computer game that eventually wipes out an entire alien race. In this book, Ender must deal with the guilt and pain of causing that race to disappear. He also has learned not to make that mistake again.I really got into this story. I do believe we will encounter alien life before the world ends. How we deal with that encounter is always a question. This book is a fictional account of one way to deal with that alien life encounter. I felt the Introduction was too long for this book. I am not one who wants all the background behind the story at the front of the book. I would rather the author explain this at at the end. I want to read the story, then will read the explanations.I find the idea of someone speaking about the dead in a manner that correctly emphasizes their life and goals as very inspiring. I have been to more funerals than I care to count, and most of the time, the dead are spoken of as almost perfect. They were not that way in life, and yet, we, the survivors, find it very difficult to express their lives in real terms. I do not intend any disrespect to the dead, but it would certainly be refreshing to have a speaker that could put their life into perspective sometimes.I would like to say \"Thank you, Orson Scott Card\", for actually being able to express these thoughts I have had for so many years. Your book should be an inspiration to the living world wide. We should never jump to conclusions about the unknown, nor should we revere the dead above their actual life.I find this book much more reality based than the first book, \"Ender's Game\". For me, it is much better, and I will definitely be reading more of this author's books. While Game is fast-paced and exciting, this book is more involved. It is not a computer simulator game story, instead, it is the story of someone's life and their struggles. While it is fiction, it is an excellent view into the future of mankind. I highly recommend this book to those readers of science fiction who allow themselves to believe in the possibility of alien life.",

        "reviewDescription": "This book got me from the instant I saw the title.  I felt compelled to read it, at least sample it.  I have not read Ender’s Game nor seen the movie.  Even though this is part of the Ender Quintet, Speaker stands on its own.  Storywise, it does come after Ender’s Game because Ender is all grown up now, but I did not feel I was missing any background and was able to piece together the history as I read the book .Speaker for the Dead is an amazing book; I could not put it down.  The author is philosophical, but in a way that makes you understand more about yourself and things around you.  I cried tears of grief and tears of great amazement in reading this book.Truth, lies, good and evil, life, death and rebirth; all defined from a slightly different point of view.The author’s introduction, explaining a bit about his thought process and how he wrote the book led me to believe there was going to be something very gory and evil in the way life is sustained on Lusitania.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The whole life cycle of the piggies turned out to be VERY different from anything we know on Earth, but so awesomely beautiful, I felt as if I could easily live in harmony with them on Lusitania.Anthropological research protocols definitely come into question in this book.  The author challenges you – what would you do in this situation?  Would you insist that these beautiful but very different beings be brought to human standards?  Would that be right?  What if YOU were that Xenador (researcher) would you do the same and try to benefit the beings you were studying or would you try cold-heartedly to stick to protocol?  I cannot even explain the depth of this author’s understanding of the human mind, fixed ideas, religion, politics, the rise and fall of civilizations; and space travel of course.If Enders Game made a good movie, Speaker for the Dead would be totally epic.This book has a fairy tale ending.  In the end, I have only one question – can we trust the hive queen?",

Honestly, it was hard for me to put down.",

Beats its prequel hands down!While Ender's Game was pretty good, this book is far more diverse, and explores a whole lot of new ideas. Card just enthralls us with this universe of his. The way he slowly builds up the piggies' world and pulls you in.. just brilliant.Characterization is top-notch. Ender is shown to be a much more complex guy, than the child prodigy as shown in #1. And the new characters are pretty awesome as well.. Jane, Miro, Human, Libo.. Everyone has a pretty vital part in the storyline.<Spoiler>The signing of the covenant between the humans and the piggies was the best part of the book. Really mind-blowing stuff, with powerful dialogues.</Spoiler>A definite must-read for SF lovers.",

        "reviewDescription": "I really enjoyed Ender's Game, but Speaker for the Dead was even better.While Ender's Game was written as background for Speaker for the Dead, I think that the books should be read in the order they were published which also makes it chronologically correct: First Ender's Game, then Speaker for the Dead (Ender in Exile is chronologically in between, but I haven't read it yet and it was published years later) In Ender's Game the story evolves around very intelligent children, which makes it interesting for both young and old. Speaker for the Dead seems more mature to me. (Be aware) I'm not sure if the book would be comprehendable and interesting enough for younger kids.The books combine an interesting sci-fi story with intelligence and unusual characters. Personally I enjoy following Ender's thoughts the most. Card describes the characters' reasoning in great detail, which is the interesting part to me while not describing every detail of every landscape or room as so many other fantasy authors do. I really appreciate that since it keeps the story going forward all the time.Even though I have to agree it is not an adventure story in the normal sense, I think in the way it discusses humanity, the impact of truth it never feels boring or too long. There is not a lot of fighting going on, rather an understanding and questions about the way humans treat other species. All in all it is a very intellectual book about how we should also treat each other in understanding our differences.I'm currently reading the third book \"Xenocide\", and would already recommend reading the whole series.",

He’s immediately sent on a rescue mission to the far side of Zuckabar, with no backup and dwindling supplies.When an unknown enemy cripples his ship on the outskirts of the system, the crew must come together and track their mysterious foe out into the unknown.An incredible discovery leads them to another system. Trapped on the wrong side of a starlane with an enemy that outguns them and civilians to rescue, Jacob must push his crew to the very edge of their ability.If he can’t, they will all die out in the black with no way to warn the Alliance of the new threat on their doorstep, and all two million souls on Kremlin Station will pay for his failure.From USA Today bestselling author Jeffery H. Haskell comes book two in the military science fiction epic in the tradition of Honor Harrington and Star Trek.

That is until the head of ONI needs a disposable officer to command a battered destroyer on the rim. \nThere’s just one problem, Interceptor hasn’t had a CO in months and the ship is a mess. Worse, the system he’s assigned to is corrupt and on the verge of all-out civil war with the Alliance. \nHowever, no one told Jacob he was disposable. \nPirates, smugglers, and Caliphate spies complicate the situation and one captain with an old ship can’t enforce the law, let alone stop anyone. \nThe single greatest discovery of all time is about to change intergalactic politics forever. If Jacob doesn’t find a way to succeed, then it won’t just be the end of the Alliance, it will be the end of freedom for humanity. \n\"Classic space fleet military science fiction in the tradition of David Weber.\" — Rick Partlow, author of Contact Front \nA New Classic in Mil SF! \n\"Compulsively readable and delightfully original.

Worse, the system he’s assigned to is corrupt and on the verge of all-out civil war with the Alliance. \nHowever, no one told Jacob he was disposable. \nPirates, smugglers, and Caliphate spies complicate the situation and one captain with an old ship can’t enforce the law, let alone stop anyone. \nThe single greatest discovery of all time is about to change intergalactic politics forever. If Jacob doesn’t find a way to succeed, then it won’t just be the end of the Alliance, it will be the end of freedom for humanity.",

        "reviewDescription": "#2 in the Grimm's War series.We follow along with the destroyer <i>Interceptor</i> and her crew as they head out to rescue some hostages held by the smarmy Guild. The Guild controls most of the tech and all of the terraformers being used by both the Alliance and their enemies, the Caliphate. (The Guild is kind of like a combination Microsoft/Apple/mafia in this universe.) Whenever there are shady doings, the Guild is behind it. The only reason they're tolerated is because they have the monopoly on terraformers. So anyway, Jacob and his crew set out to find the hostages. They find more than they bargained for, too.The characters are just as enjoyable as the first book. They each have distinct personalities, mannerisms and quirks. Jacob isn't a Special Snowflake, either.  He makes mistakes and follows suggestions from his crew. I really like the cast! The pacing was decent, too. Things moved along fairly quickly and I was never bored.I could sit here and nitpick my issues with the series but none of them are really earth shattering. The use of modern slang and the stereotypical religion/society of the main enemy were the two main detractors. Despite these flaws, I plan to read the next one in the series.",

There are no boring, middle-of-a-trilogy bridge moments here.Haskell writes about great space battles and cool tech but his strong point is definitely his character building. I believe these crew members exist. As a matter of fact, I’m pretty sure I served with someone exactly like most of them.The crew is loyal to Grimm and for good reason.This book has a positive theme and is a feel-good book. We know Grimm’s going to win. The fun part is watching it as it happens.I’m excited to read  the last one.Highest recommendation. Phenomenal book!",

This therefore is a connecting bridge between the old generation and the new, though the old does not a backseat.Connections between certain lifeforms living in gaseous and liquid conditions and Gabi are discovered, though someone doesn't want these uncovered.... There appears to be a new (or is it an old) foe who maybe trying to thwart the success of the Nexus and exploit humanity as certain events occur and clues are uncovered.This novel dwells deeply on Parenthood and your fears for your children as well as introducing the new generation as they learn the ropes. There is suspense, surprise, intrigue and the return of almost all the old favourites in this novel that relaunches/continues the Backyard Starship saga. A fun read for all fans and new converts to the series.",

        "reviewDescription": "Love this series. I actually thought it was over once the kiddos graduated in that final scene if book (?) 25.  I thought then that the kids were going to be a spinoff from there. Imagine my surprise when I found that wasn’t the case and I’d already missed a couple of new releases. That doesn’t usually happen. I usually place release dates in calendar so I can get it immediately. That’s how much I love this group of characters, their history, present and where they’re headed. I esp love the amount of action and drama within each book. You literally never know what kind of trouble they’ll find next. I didn’t find this one near as dramatic as the last time they had a huge run in with a politician who ultimately betrays themselves as a character ready to take down the crew or Earth, itself. One of the big differences was the extreme limited character interaction this time around compared to that past character, who was a similar, enemy character.The finale was good, if a bit rushed & I’m looking forward to next book.‼️Spoiler alert******‼️I still do not understand the reason behind the appearance of the fake US ship at the moon where the Darko crew were doing research on new alien beings. It served no purpose other than to clue the crew and subsequently Van that all was not well on Earth and their first target was the politician. But again, for what purpose? Why draw attention to yourself when you’ve laid low from the law, at least, if not the public , this whole time? All it did was place a giant target on his back. So why do that? And he didn’t show interest after that, even though the Drako continued its research flights. That part just doesn’t make sense to me. Maybe the next book will bring it all together. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤞🤞. PS—I’m hoping they find a way (or Myriam decides to take the anti-aging meds) to turn time back or, at least to slow it down now that she has finally found her own happy story. After all, she’s given her life to help raise and protect Van; it would seem a small way to thank her and keep her as part of the story, especially when she could be more a part of something substantial with her new male friend.",

        "reviewDescription": "The story is fine, although a little sparse on the action & derring do of earlier episodes.What I found jarring was the interminable & inappropriate switching in and out of first-person - sometimes in the same paragraph.A half-day from a decent editor could have fixed this, or even a re-read by the authors. The whole thing seems to have been somewhat rushed to market.That said, I'm still looking forward to the next installment.",

One last hope for humanity.A ship pulled out of mothballs by the original crew, sent to fight a war humanity was losing.Glory barely survived its last battle twenty years earlier. Captain Drake resigned rather than face court martial. But the enemy is back. Humanity needs everything that can fly.Maybe it’s not the ship at all, but the crew. They hold the key.Drake rallies old and young alike to comply with orders so secret, even he wasn’t allowed to see them until after the ship left the junkyard. Would it leave? That was another question. The core hadn’t been fired in twenty years.The smell of decay filled the massive ship’s corridors. The stench of death lingered, the death of Drake’s crew, a nightmare from long ago.The Paragon have weapons that humanity couldn’t contemplate. But here they were, suing for peace. The people of Earth jumped at the carrot. The end of war! Could it be too good to be true?Drake had his orders from an admiral who knew too much. Glory must launch.And with it, the fate of humanity rested on the shoulders of a broken crew, carrying a weapon like no other, hoping for one clear shot.One last chance for Glory.",

        "reviewDescription": "Holy crap, this was a great read! I went through this book in like 5 days because I could not put it down. I was going to bed early and planning time when I could read it it was so good. A book has not picked me up and taken me along with it using unstoppable force as a 100-foot wave in a long time. This was just excellent!I've known Ira Heinichen is a great writer since I read his debut novel Star Stuff, and Ira is lucky I'm a watchmaker with a lot of patience waiting for the Escape from Red Tower book 2. He was so good it is worth the wait. When I saw him team up with Craig Martelle, one of the undisputed masters of military sci-fi, it was a no-brainer. That was an insta-click for me. You put two phenomenal writers like that together and magic happens. And it did.The story and storyline were outstanding. The characters were true to life, flawed, and real, and relatable. The book reads like a movie, and it WOULD make a great movie.I do not want to go into any plot and it would be unfair to reveal spoilers. Suffice it to say that an unstoppable alien force, the Paragon, with more dirty tricks than seems possible, better technology, and unstoppable resources wants to swat the human race like a fly and exterminate us. Our saviors: 1 retired old starship captain, one untried crew, one untested fighter commander, and one great XO. once mighty ship in her Glory (sic) days, now mothballed, decrepit, and about done. And that's what we're counting on to save us. There are battles galore, between people, aliens, fighters, and capital ships. There are surprise saves, and there are some really, really big \"didn't see that coming\" surprises. Not to mention a cyborg marine, and - wait for it - a cyborg dog!I went through this book like Grant went through Richmond. And folks, I was preparing for a final defense on an advanced degree when I started this and finished it 5 days later. Not good planning to be sleep-deprived because I can't put the book down! (I still got an A).Suffice it to say, that this book would get 6 or 7 stars if I could give them. Will I read the 2nd book in the series, not yet published? Already pre-ordered! Would I recommend this? Hail, yes! Look, you can't go to theme parks and ride terrifying roller coasters at the moment due to the 'rona, so you might as well save the money and the hassle and just read this book.Craig, Ira, I know the Paragon aren't done yet, and there is a lot more story to tell. Keep writing",

        "reviewDescription": "I just finished Glory: Humanity's Last Hope and I am eager to continue the series. The story is riveting and the cast of characters is unsurpassed. Ira Heinichen and Craig Martell create an epic story. The action is unrelenting and it contrasts the best of humanity versus an implacable enemy in the Paragon. The battles are plotted well and just when you think the stakes can't be higher - they get exponentially higher. Craig Martell's real world experience and Ira Heinichen's screen writer's eye for action and character development keep the reader immersed in the story.  This book would make an incredible movie yet I think no screen adventure would equal the pictures in my mind from the authors' prose. The ending is stirring, I got a little choked up and was sorry for the story to end -EXCEPT: the story ends with a foreshadowing to the next book Away we go!! Thanks for a absorbing read that took me away!",

It's also a feel good story about outsiders, the rejected, the old finding their place and their usefulness. And for someone like me who's never served in the armed forces, it gave some sense of what makes those who do serve tick.Highly recommend.

There aren't characters in a book, they are people you know and would easily pick out of a crowd. The endings are always sad - because you have to be away from your new friends for a while. You find yourself missing them.I really hope they come out with a line of merchandise for this series. I'd love to wear Captain Grimm's red hat.",

He captured blue teams essence, there individual traits and personalities down to Fred's jokes about everything. His character building is also on point and the action scenes, pretty much the whole book, make sense and are thrilling. Also he started to turn John into more a personal person not just a legend who is all business. Worth the time to read and looking forward to more from Mr Denning",

Also, the word \"Lechatelierite\" is used throughout the book A LOT, which got comically annoying after the first 15 times. Overall, this is a great read that any Halo fan will surely enjoy!",

        "reviewDescription": "*NON SPOILER REVIEW*Out of the 4 books that I have read of Denning, he always has good stories. The books as a whole almost always turn out to be a very good read. My only issue with Troy Denning's writing style (and this may just be me) is that I time and time again have issues in my minds eye visualizing the characters. Namely the directions that the characters are facing or where things are positioned. This may be a small complaint, especially since I say that his books are overall always good, but it does prove to disrupt the flow of the reading for me.With that being said, this book in particular was phenomenal in all of the right ways. To me, for those who watch anime, I would compare it similarly to how I have heard many compare One Piece to Naruto. Whereas Naruto focuses on individual plotlines and character development, One Piece lends more to world building. The Shadows of Reach spends a considerable time building the world in between and during  the missions, dialogue, and battle sequences. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The fall of Reach (Naruto) builds who the Spartans are. The Shadows of Reach (One Piece) returns to reach and builds up the world so to speak. obviously, you can say much more about the two but you get my drift.If I could add one more thing, read: Silent Storm, oblivion, Outcasts (standalone but to me is a sequel and necessary to fully appreciate Oblivion), then The shadows of Reach.",

        "reviewDescription": "Troy Denning has two of the three current threads of the Halo novels extended-universe. The first two \"A Master Chief\" stories occurred in a time in the Official Halo Timeline where John, Kelly, Fred, and Linda were teenagers, after Reach but before Halo: CE. Those felt like a retcon, but they didn't retcon anything, just added a story into the lore where there was a gap and/or no story (they put something in that really didn't need to be there since it was a past story and we already know how things played out, so it was self-contained and felt like a waste of time).This story, however, is after Last Light (so Fred has joined back up with his Blue Team group) and also after Halo 5: Guardians, and before Halo: Infinite. Unfortunately, H:I retcons this book in-that the game is the first time of Chief meeting Atriox and Escharum... in this book, however, the ending has Blue Team encountering Atriox and Escharum, including Master Chief, so it sorta felt like a letdown in the game that they ignored this book (like how Bungie ignored all the books in the original Halo trilogy).This book is great! Lots of exposition, and just the right amount of dialogue between Blue Team.",

        "reviewDescription": "I will address the 4 book series.  I have already posted a review for book Return to the Galaxy.  I finished the next three books (Reach for the Galaxy, Explore the Galaxy, and Seek the Galaxy.  As an indication of how much I enjoyed these book, I finished them in slightly less than 3 weeks: sometimes reading to 3 AM.  I anxiously await the release of book 5 (around the end of November).  If you enjoy character development sprinkled with a little intense action, these books are a great read.  They continue the two main story lines that are slowly converging - one over years and the other over centuries.  The action is mainly on earth and a small part of our solar system and deep space over 1000's of light years slowly heading for a merging down the line.I found the writing slowly maturing as the books progressed.  I just recently discovered the these are the author's first books!  Books 5,6 and 7 are planned.",

        "reviewTitle": "Explore the Galaxy by BA Gillies",
        "reviewDescription": "I continue to marvel at Gillies’ ability to take a common trope in science fiction—the space opera—and fill it full of  intriguing, fresh concepts and new ideas.Admiral Velal and her people face battles in Explore the Galaxy that demonstrate the greatest of heroism, superb strategy and especially, tactics. I am reminded of the battles in David Weber’s Honorverse. While the tactics are similar, as is the bravery and unflinching sacrifice, Gillies’ battles are condensed and more easily understood (at least by me). Otherwise, while Weber’s Honorverse is also a space opera, it is very different from Gillies’ Galaxy series. However, much as I love the Honorverse, overall I think Gillies’ writing quality is equal to Weber’s, just not its quantity!On earth, Ewan and company continue plans to bring the Saret’s scientific advances into common use globally so that humans will be able to defend earth if/when the Ranid attack. They face increasing problems from countries who want control of these advances for their own use, control and profit.Ewan and several others leave earth hoping to find other Saret colonies to aid in defending against the Ranid. They have many adventures before returning to serious trouble on earth. In addition, intelligence agents from several nations have begun to suspect and fear alien involvement in earth’s affairs, and are determined to interrogate SUS’ top recruits/Ewan, basically whoever else they can kidnap.While this series is very complex, with its large number of characters, multiple timelines, many locations, and multiple storylines, I always knew when in relation to the rest of the story and where a storyline was happening, what was happening in each section, why and to whom it was happening. I marvel at Gillies’ ability to conceive of this huge story, and then to organize it all to accomplish this successfully. It is nothing short of amazing.I continue to believe BA Gillies’ Galaxy series is superior to any other new science fiction I’ve read in years. Its latest entry, Book 4: Explore the Galaxy, is even better than the previous novel, Seek the Galaxy. It has space battles, Saret-planted colonies, planets suitable for new colonies, conflicts, betrayals, and more.I strongly recommend this series to everyone who likes speculative fiction. I suggest beginning with Book 1, Return to the Galaxy. I give Explore the Galaxy  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ out of five stars.BookloverOctober 9, 2025",

Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Hanson must rise as the last officer capable of organizing resistance. The enemy is relentless, the odds are impossible, and the cost of every decision grows heavier by the hour.\nCut off from the CSV Margaret Thatcher, with limited personnel and few supplies, Arthur struggles to stay upright under the pressure of command. Yet, through every loss and every sacrifice, he keeps fighting.\nAs covert ops attempt to bring distant SATO allies into the fight, Arthur must hold the line against overwhelming odds—and strike from the shadows to hit the enemy where it hurts them the most.\nBecause heroes aren’t fearless. They’re the ones who fight anyway.",

President Robbins and her lackeys play their usual appeasement game and once again General Cohen has his hands tied from ending this invasion by sending in the fleet. It will take some ingenious behind the scenes maneuvering to break the deadlock. Enter General Sinclair. You’ll find some great guerilla ground combat as well as space battles in this book. I loved the intrigue and out of the box thinking in this story. A guaranteed page turner.",

There is chaos in New Rostov and Lt Arthur Hanson is the last officer standing to organize a resistance.  One thing that I really like about a Daniel Gibbs story is how realistic the story and procedures are.  The fighting is extraordinary and the author's military knowledge shines.  Join Lt Hanson and jump into a wonderful story.  I received an arc for free and am leaving my review voluntarily.",

    "bookDescription": "Kill a man and you're a murderer. Kill a million and you're a statesman. Dirk should have killed more people.Dirriken Friedel used his aristocratic connections to rescue his troops. He didn’t plan on starting a war or killing them himself. Now he spends his days in jail, waiting for an assassin sent by his dead officers families to end his misery.\nWhen he’s broken out by off-duty marines he has a chance to start over, if he’s worthy. During his ramshackle escape he collects a broken-down trading ship, a bitter former army officer, a genetically altered religious fanatic, a runaway ingenue, a sham engineer, and a murderous femme fatal. Pursed by a fanatical imperial tribune bent on bloody justice, can he keep the crew from killing each other, the ship from exploding, and himself from the bottom of a bottle. Or would it be easier just to give up?If you like Galactic Empires, honorable enemies, and snappy dialog, this one’s for you.",

        "reviewDescription": "Humanity itself at risk from alien invasion, the opportunity for galactic saviors to arise.Massive wars, naive friends, consistently prominent, pathetic good guys with plucky, plot-contorted success. Main characters who assemble an assorted cast of good people so they can “struggle” against slavers and genocides and hurt feelings before eventually cleaning them all out so they can be paladins for justice, complete with justifiably urine-scented capes while anything of value is “redeemed” in a new world order. Almost every space book on here is unpalatable and downright embarrassing for everyone involved. This author usually offers a decent contrast from the norm.I like the smaller scale and rough characters. They aren’t good people. They don’t have noble, “heroic” inner shells. They’re just people with their own motivations. Calling them criminals, let alone villains, is a stretch but they aren’t representing any childish wish fulfillment. That takes life experience and I think it’s actually pretty consistent for this author’s work. There are quite a few insightful human observations tucked away even if the dialog frequently veers from witty to indulgent. I think it’s obvious the purpose of this is to be fun and not to delve anywhere deep so it’s nothing to be uncharitable with.There are hints this new series will risk melting into a story about heroes, however, so the risk isn’t entirely done away with. If that happens without changing the description of this first title to warn anyone I’ll change the score down to a 2/5. What we do have is well written and entertaining for what it is. The new cast, setting, and idea for this crew are promising.",

        "reviewDescription": "I received an advance copy for review purposes and I enjoyed the book so much I also purchased it. Imperial Deserter kept me up exceedingly late two nights running. Few books have me reading till past 3am but this was one of them.Moriarty has crafted an excellent novel full of interesting and complex characters.  If you are a fan of Firefly you’ll find a lot to like here.  Part of the fun of the story is watching how the motley crew of characters who have been thrown together interact, with Dirk trying to ride herd and keep things from imploding (or exploding!).The writing is polished and every scene counts.  If you enjoyed Moriarty’s Trans Galatic Insurance (TGI) series you’ll likely appreciate this book as well, but it isn’t necessary to have read TGI first.  His first series is a little more light-hearted in style, but I still found myself chuckling out loud in parts of Imperial Deserter.The book works well as a satisfying stand-alone novel and we aren’t left with a cliff hanger but it is clear that there are more adventures to come.  The characters obviously have well developed back-stories and I’m looking forward to discovering more about their pasts as the series progresses.Buy this if you enjoy well-written character driven sci-fi with resourceful (but flawed) protagonists, trying to hold things together in the face of adversity.",

But it seemed that Dirk was just a minor character in the book. There was more adventures written about every other character. He was supposed to be the Captain and the command decisions he made were basically on the lines of “everyone should get along” and “let’s go there”.Other problems with the book that I had was the childish swearing and the fact that even though people had guns they never actually shot anyone, except in that one adventure on Dena’s planet. Even the Dirk character, who was supposed to be a quick draw never shot the thugs who came for Ana and Scruggs.",

At the same time not everyone involved in their pursuit really wants to catch up with them.  It should make for future interesting interactions.Anyone who likes a storyline with flashes of humour and believable dialogue should find this book well worth reading. Personally I decided to buy the next book in series before I was 20% of the way through this one and look forward to reading more about their further adventures.",

    "bookDescription": "When Earth's colonies go silent, Legion Varus drops onto Kepler-62 expecting a routine investigation. Instead, they find something far worse than death.\nThe colonists aren't dead—they're changed. A new kind of enemy has arrived in Province 921, microscopic invaders that transform humans into perfectly coordinated killing machines. These \"Demon\" parasites don't just control minds, they improve them, creating an army that works with terrifying efficiency.\nAs cities fall and soldiers turn against their own, Centurion James McGill discovers he's mysteriously immune to infection. But immunity comes with a price. To save humanity from becoming pawns of a new Galactic species, McGill must navigate a web of seduction, betrayal, and impossible choices.\nSome invasions come with warships. Others come with a whisper, a touch, and a promise of something better. The question is: what happens when the enemy might be right?\nDEMON WORLD is the latest action-packed entry in B.V. Larson's bestselling Undying Mercenaries series.",

This story had a lot of unexpected twists and turnsto it. James was juggling family drama and galactic problems at the same time. Throw in an unusual love interest and  a lot of brutal fighting against impossible odds. Then you have the makings of a great story.",

That really seemed to be something obvious and avoidable; the pattern was always to make any infringement destroyable, renounceable, or deniable!This may not change everything, but it changes a lot. The new storyline offers a lot, and it's extremely unsettling.I do hope we get a cloud city, maybe suspended from a moon into a gas giant? There was a book written by an author who committed suicide because he thought he was a failure, because his publisher didn't tell him how well he was selling. I don't recall his name offhand, but his stories really were good, and Baen picked up rights to republish. I think he had one, about Earth sending indestructible robots to explore Jupiter, and Jupiter's native species deciding on peace because it. I think a nod to that could work really well with the big guy!",

I'd only be repeating that info here. What I want you to know is that Scalzi is a genius Writer (with a capital \"W\"). \"Writer\" seems so pedestrian when referring to Scalzi. Better to describe him as \"Novelist\" or \"Storyteller\" or \"Wordmonger\" (maybe not that last one). Or \"Craftsman.\" His stories are clever and brilliant, all unique, humorous and dramatic, believable...yet out there. If you want to get your mind off your troubles, or the troubles of the world, or you want to let go of your disbeliefs willingly (like a movie), or you need some frivolity, or you like plot twists and turns, or you think you can guess what's coming next or later in a story (like I do) but you get it totally wrong, or you just want a tale that blows your mind, read one of John Scalzi's books.

        "reviewTitle": "Satisfying Completion to The Last Colony",
        "reviewDescription": "Much of this book is a repetition of the original story in The Last Colony. Since you may already know that, I will attempt to avoid more disclosures that could be spoilers. While you many know the past, you start right away seeing things from her perspective. She is a teenage girl right out of 1960's Iowa, pure and simple, living in idyllic Huckleberry. How she became that girl is glossed over, as it is in previous works. One would expect a more cautious and wary personality from what we know of her.Here she is. You learn the backstory first. This young girl has some reason to be jaded or suffering from a sense of victimhood, but is happy and well adjusted to life with her odd parents. Dad is an ancient American, but not as ancient by a few hundred years as he needs to be for this story. Formerly a modern warrior himself he would be capable of wiping out the entire colony personally. Her mom is an artificially created human who sprang full grown into life as an elite warrior, capable of laying low entire Seal teams and dad. How does Scalzi make them loving and caring parents modeled from the days of Leave It To Beaver? I don't know. He sort of slips into it in his previous books, but it makes sense in Scalzi's Old Man's War series is as curious a blend of political corruption and idealism triumphant as you would ever read and believe. These people belong in that universe as he pulls that off again. They all must be from Iowa. And the two alien bodyguards? Bodyguards who would easily kill everyone she knows, including her mother, to keep her from any harm and are the representatives of a powerful alien race that worships her. The threat of displeasing her keeps them in line, barely. Now, you may wonder how any adventure could come to a girl surrounded by such an array as this. You don't know teenage girls.From a teenage girl's point of view of her life on the Last Colony of Roanoke you have: intelligent and dangerous pet alien monsters, slobbery dog, benign neglectful parents with just the right touch of mature wisdom, boys, girls, boys and girls again, politics, an alien planet complete with more aliens, and one other revered meta, keeping important secrets from the adults. You have to love that last one, from Tom Sawyer to Harry Potter, untold secrets are where the drama is.There's a story for you. Yet you still believe she is just your average middle class 1960's midwestern American girl with an iPad.She is immediately thrust into an adventure from her agraian life right into the rigors of colonizing an alien planet. Typical of a teenage girl, she discovers the terrible secret of the the mission before her parents, the leaders of the colony. Not by much, but a coup none the less that begins the story of how she and her friends are working their way to the same conclusion of the story as her parents and the rest of the colonists. The story is about her, her female and male friends and how life with the powerless develops parallel to the powers-that-be. She eventually becomes the story and the proud progeny of her parents. Although she's not, really. You may not notice that until you think about it.She is believable to me in the context of the story, There are some jerks and stops as the story gets started, but then Scalzi has to make this work and he does.Zoe is sort of like a midwestern Podkayne. The similarities between the two jumped out at me as I started this book. Not that the stories are anything alike other than teenage girl heroines written by male writers. But I think she is the teenage girl men who like women think of, when they are not designing killer aliens and enhanced humans with neat hardware to deal with them.Definitely worth the read and completes The Lost Colony nicely.",

The same story, but from the teenage daughter’s (Zoe‘s) point of view? The author admits that this  book was in part intended for high school libraries. I didn’t think much of the idea of teenage romances, etc.But I was wrong. This book is excellent. It provides additional details and a whole new perspective. I really enjoyed it.",

    "bookDescription": "The final enemy has been revealed, and it's more insidious than Van could ever imagine, spanning space and time with the patience of immortality—and an utter disregard for all forms of life.On the run and broken, the Equal Grasp faces elimination on earth and everywhere else, their leader gone, their mission a shambles, and with new agents of justice hard on their heels.But the fight isn't over. In fact, it's just begun, and Van knows that every decision he's made for the past decade will come to bear on who lives, and who dies—And who is meant to rule over a universe where freedom and justice are the ultimate pursuit. At any cost, Van and his crew will finish the job, but they're going to need a lot of help from people and beings who have been observers.Until now.The time for watching is over. The time for victory is now. But the cost might be more than anyone can pay, and Van is no longer merely an agent of justice. He's a father, a husband, and a friend—and he's going to need every connection in the stars to defeat the ultimate enemy and save his people.",

        "reviewDescription": "I love the characters in this book. They’re not just human and the aliens are all very unique.  All of them have very discerning personalities which just get better with each book. Above all, I love their banter, their humor, their witty one liners and arguments like sibling kids. The crew, with its family atmosphere, just continues to grow, thrive and surprise us with some of the most random things, like movie productions. There’s a lot going on in this crew’s life. They’re being pulled in many directions. The biggest threats being Calamity and the ever present traitorous Guild leaders and those who follow them—either,believing their bogus propaganda or they’re true believers in the abuse of power and are willing participants in that endeavor. The story seems to hop around a lot but that just cements the rather random chaos this crew and their Allie’s are fighting. A bold move at the end will either help them them or doom them.",

Especially when I got all caught up and had to wait for the next new book.And here I am, again, waiting for the next volume. Thanks ok, lots to read in the meantime!24 was pretty good. Lots of action, world building and interesting developments. My only complaint is that it took the entire book just to reach the ultimate step of what we knew was going to happen. And when i5 did it was an anti-climax. After all that happened Van and his band of merry sentients are not any closer to their actual goal.To end on a positive note I appreciate how Van is able to listen to his friends and let them help him make honorable, ethical decisions. It’s almost like a video game and we are given choices. All of which will advance the plot, but not all of which give the “A+” ending.I’m glad I picked this series up all those months ago.  Time well spent!Cheers!",

That said, this author needs to figure out how his FTL works, it's completely skipped over.  There's some reference to fuel, some to teleporting, no one mentions how any of this works.  There's refueling stations, different stages of techonology, boarding vessels, none of the thrust or anything else is figured out it's all just thrown at you.  Really took me out of it.",

The characters are believable, though flawed (but not too flawed) humans and the “bad guys” ( the Ornu) are totally disgusting but also believable.

I also like that they don’t use crude language and I can recommend this series to my friends without having to issue an “R rating” disclaimer.

        "reviewDescription": "The book does not have an ending.  There are also a number of things not done, e.g., why wasn't Val asked if he could fix the Kettering whatever?  What was Val anyway? He sure was a stick-in-the-mud snot.  If he were the authors' idea of a moral conscience, I see him failing by not acknowledging certain moral dilemmas.  With most of these space battle stories, the idea of logistics is never addressed. In this book we at least get a little lip service as we acknowledge that food is in short supply, but then we load a bunch of refugees,  we acknowledge the weapons are finite, but fire 50 missiles at a time.  What the heck?  The story moves along with good character development of captain Bill, Al & Biria, but the rest not so good.  They are all survivors of the defeat of earth, and are now slave labor on a space ship under the supervision of their conquerors who control by the threat of exploding a device implanted in their chest.  They all dream of freedom, but know that rebellion would result in their death.  That is, until they're sent on an exercise to board a gigantic derelict left behind by an ancient race called primevals. It turns out to be sentient, and it decides to side with the humans supporting their wish to be free.  So then things get interesting as we follow the various problems the humans get into along with their frustratingly incomplete solutions.",

It’s kind of a literary snack food - a little salty, pungent in spots, but not exactly filling. It feels like Henry, the major character, gets short shrift through most of this story, and the unfolding story of the captain and his issues takes up too much space. Mostly it feels as if a good editor would really help this story. Doubt if I will read any more of this series.",

        "reviewDescription": "Humanity has been conquered by the Onru, a serpent like race that uses the races they conquer to wage their wars. Captain Bill Henderson is trying to keep his crew together while maintaining peaceful relations with the on ship Onru monitor. Any misstep could result in his death at the hands of the twitchy, onboard, monitor, Nonus.A mysterious message from a long dead race has been received by the communications officer of the ship. The Onru are always on the lookout for tech from this race; tech that they can twist into some form of weapon to keep their vassal races subject to them. This time the tech turns out to be a lost starship controlled by an onboard AI. The Onru are exited over the find but soon find themselves at the mercy of their human vassals which are the only ones the AI will communicate with.If he plays his cards right, Captain Henderson has before him the potential to turn the tables on the Onru. The ship AI is not open to just any request from Henderson so progress is slow. Henderson has to make the ship AI happy while keeping the Onru believing he is doing his best to follow their orders. The Onru quickly become frustrated with Henderson’s efforts and begin threatening him with death if he doesn’tprovide results. Our story takes off at this point with plot twists and turns as Henderson tries to work with the ship AI to save humanity and still keep the Onru satisfied long enough for his plans to come to fruition.This is a great read. I highly recommend it and am looking forward very much to the next novel in the trilogy.",

I can understand that the authors found it fitting in order to gave the characters more background.For me, that was taking too long.However, once our crew got the ship - or should I say, the ship got the crew? , for that ship sure isn't showing all its cards -, then the story is one of it's kind and marvellously done.There is lots of action, very well-written and captivating. There are hard choices to be made, which made the plot fascinating at many points. Omega's actions and evaluations on some protagonists' decisions are letting you guess on his motives, which made for an Intriguing plot, indeed.Some main characters choices were captivating to witness.So, all in all, a splendid, very interesting plot.

There are various sub-plots woven in, typically with each chapter told from the point of view of one character, and multiple timelines (although this is not a time travel tale). This broke up the reading in a way that kept me engaged and wanting to know what happens next. There is a very broad range of situations and events that put the characters and their principles to the test. Funny parts, too. There is a lot of heart in these stories. Recommended.",

        "reviewDescription": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Gillies has done it again! Reach for the Galaxy is the sequel to Return to the Galaxy, and is even better. Through memory recordings of people who lived through it, we learn more galactic history. In Return, Velal was a space cruiser captain at the beginning of the mutiny of the alien Ranid, a reptilian species which had been part of the Foundation 250 years. The Ranids’ plan is the genocide of all humans. Now Velal is a fleet admiral, responsible for millions of refugees.In Return, Ewan Scott partnered with an avatar, Jera, to prepare Earth to defend against the Ranid, who are on their way. In Reach to the Galaxy, more people join Ewan in this effort, and some are excited to explore the neighborhood (our solar system). Ewan’s plan to prepare Earth technologically faces challenges.Like Return, this ebook appears to be professionally edited; I noticed only one typo. Some people might be offended by some characters’ personal relationships and their sexual behavior. However, while sex is part of the story, it is never explicit but behind closed doors.Also, Reach for the Galaxy ends with a cliffhanger. Frankly, I despise them, but even Heinlein wrote an occasional cliffhanger, and I have to admit, this ending is incredibly effective. I am SO eager to read the next book! The problem is waiting for it; I’m not known for my patience. 😊 (Yes, I still believe Gillies will reach Heinlein’s stature someday.)Even if I removed a star because of the cliffhanger, Reach is so good, by rights it would have plenty to spare. You know, ten so extra stars. Unfortunately, I can’t give it that many stars (Amazon can be so unreasonable!) 🙂  so I give Reach to the Galaxy by BA Gillies ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.BookloverJuly 30 2025",

Set in a believable near-future Earth, it cleverly interweaves history from a distant space civilization, adding depth and scale. It's an outstanding mix of military sci-fi and epic storytelling.

Since then, the depleted forces of Earth’s alliances have rebuilt their fleets, staffing old warships with freshly trained troops. Torn between the need to beat the Lankies to the punch and taking enough time to put together an effective fighting force, command has decided to strike now.\nOnce again, seasoned veterans Andrew and Halley find themselves in charge of green troops and at the sharp tip of the spear as the combined military might of Earth goes up against the Lankies. But if there’s one constant in war, it’s that no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy…and the Lankies want to hold on to Mars as badly as humanity wants to reclaim it.",

        "reviewDescription": "I have really enjoyed each of Marko Kloos' Frontlines books. Not only are they well written, but he tells a good story- not always easy in military science-fiction. When an author chooses to write in a first-person narrative style, often they fall victim to the old trope of \"telling, instead of showing.\" I never feel that way in this series- like life, the story evolves in an \"organic\" fashion, and makes for a very enjoyable read. Like his other books, this one is full of Easter eggs and sly little winks to his audience, which always brought a grin to my face as I was reading- and I'm sure there are more I didn't catch.If I have one complaint- it's an oft-heard one; these books are WAY TOO SHORT! :) I tear through them in a few hours, so they can feel like a novella more than a full novel. In fact, as I have done for Books 2-4, I will probably re-read the series in order over the next day or two.I really like this world, the story and this writing style, and I hope we don't have to wait a year for the next one!",

        "reviewDescription": "The fifth book in the Frontlines series, Fields of Fire drops us immediately into Humanity's big push to eradicate the Lanky threat at Earth's doorstep.Much of the novel is spent in the build-up to assaulting Mars, the current stronghold of the alien Lankies within the solar system. Again Marko Kloos leans on his real-world combat experience to deliver a great novel that honestly only has a few flaws.Mr. Kloos once again expands the world of Frontlines by bringing in new human factions, most notably the Eurocorps, the European Union's fighting force. Although small and previously unseen, Kloos manages to make this new faction interesting by showing their different route of approach to warfare as opposed to the North American Commonwealth and the SIno-Russian Alliance, the two largest factions in the series. It is easily the highlight of the novel, seeing this new injection of tech and fighting blood as the clock ticks closer to zero hour for the assault on Mars. And some intriguing turn of events shed new light on the still highly alien Lankies, giving them slightly more depth as we begin to see how their technology functions, and that they are more than just plodding proto-dinosaur aliens that simply charge blindly into the bullets of the main characters.However, as thrilling as the combat sequences are, I felt that Mr. Kloos spent far too much time focusing on locations that, while they forward the story, seem rather boring and somewhat clumsy. The sequence in Greenland, for example, very much comes off as an attempt to write horror and it stumbles more often than it succeeds. Another flaw is that Mr. Kloos increasingly over-sells the romantic sub-plot between the main character and his wife Halley. There's one thrilling moment in the romantic plot, however, and I found that singular moment almost more enjoyable than the rest of the novel put together.Once again Mr. Kloos's characterizations and descriptions are massively improved over the first two novels of the series, but he drags his heels somewhat and there's more than a little filler before the main event. However when the Battle for Mars kicks off, it's hard to turn your eyes away. Mr. Kloos simply needs to work on refining the romantic sub-plot to being less tedious. Again and I mean no offense by it, the romance between Grayson and Halley just feels like a mirror or a podium that Mr. Kloos can climb up on and say how much he loves his actual wife. It just got pretty tiresome.All in all, another excellent read with a few flaws that hold what honestly feels like a series book-end back.",

But if you've read any of the prior works, you need this book now.Kloos takes so many conventions of the genre and subtly turns them on their ear. Yes, the pace is exceptionally tense - the action graphic and fast - the descriptions of military hardware exacting and precise. But he does something relatively rare in the field.He makes the reader genuinely care about the protagonist. Not just the immediate goals of surviving the next engagement with the enemy, but his life, his dreams, his friends and his wife.Kloos is a veteran himself and makes use of that knowledge through his words, not in the context of traditional military science matters; but rather the mundane \"Jarhead\" type of descriptions. What a mess hall is like, how it feels to be on call 24 x 7, navigating the organization to get things done. It is these little nuggets of authenticity which don't move the plot forward, but breathe life into the pages which make the series for me.And I do have to admit that the final few pages of the novel were the most tension-filled of ANY novel I've read in recent years.Simply put, another top shelf offering from a great writer.",

        "reviewDescription": "I thought quite highly of Marko Kloos \"Frontlines\" series, calling it the best of ground-based mil sci-fi.  Somehow, the fifth book in the series raised the bar even further!.  It's Earth against the Lankies in Greenland and on Mars, so for setting alone it is worth reading.  But it is not a homogenous \"Terran\" force but one made up of Americans like Lt. Grayson and his wife Halley and also Russians and a variety of Europeans; Chinese are fighting the Lankies, too, but out of our sight.  Their equipment is advanced but understandable, and Mr. Kloos stays very true to the limitations of the soldiers' arms and armor.The gigantic Lankies are some of the best and most \"alien\" foes in the genre.  We never truly understand them, though the range of their capabilities become a bit more evident in this book.  They have taken Mars, trapping our settlers in a number of large bunkers while the Lanky version of terraforming is done.  Clearly, a Lanky presence there cannot be allowed to remain, so the stakes are never in doubt.  The drop ships and SI troopers are needed, but the task is one that may be too much.Finally, the writing is first rate and some of it, particularly at home in Liberty Falls, rises above the genre.  A pleasure to read!",

        "reviewDescription": "A estas alturas de la serie, ya no cabe duda que Kloos me tiene más que ganado, pero es que incluso con todo lo que ha pasado en los anteriores libros, el autor sigue dando más. No voy a entrar en detalles para no hacer spoilers, tan solo diré que me sorprende cómo sigue sacándose de la manga nuevas situaciones y nuevas batallas cada vez más épicas y espectaculares. Puede que esta saga no pase a la historia de la literatura o de la SF, pero disfruto como un enano leyéndola. ¿Qué más se puede pedir?",

I love the fact that Andrew Grayson and Halley are two very ordinary people who happen to find themselves in the melting pot time and again. The action scenes are good, although I find it hard to keep track sometimes - my issue since I find visualisation impossible. However, what I really enjoyed this time around was the moments of stillness before the battle and the sense of real affection that Andrew has for his comrades - particularly for the Russian Dmitry. It makes the characters seem more real. Really looking forward to the next book in the series.",
