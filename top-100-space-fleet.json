The trip will take months just to travel one way. They pick up some skilled mechanics and what they assume will be plenty of spare parts.Unfortunately, what they discover will require more than they brought with them.They find a war-ravaged planet, where the survivors are reduced to jungle-dwelling primitives, and the remaining AIs are intent on exterminating all the surviving aliens.",

The Warmaster Horus’ bloody seven-year crusade has led to this: the cradle of mankind, where he is to kill his father, the Emperor. With the war at this critical juncture, Sanguinius, primarch of the loyalist Blood Angels, braves the horrors of the Warmaster’s flagship, The Vengeful Spirit, with a single purpose in mind: to slay his brother Horus, decapitate the Heresy once and for all, and stop the forces of Chaos from taking Holy Terra. But at the whim of a Warmaster fallen so far from grace, the Dark Gods will not make Sanguinius’ task an easy one, and as the war edges towards its explosive, bloody conclusion, events are about to unfold that could either save humanity, or plunge it headlong into an eternity of darkness.",

  "bookDescription": "From the New York Times bestselling author of the Expanse comes a spectacular new space opera that sees humanity fighting for its survival in a war as old as the universe itself. ★ “Masterful . . . . This is space opera at its best.” – Publishers Weekly (starred review) \"The start of something truly epic.\" ― Fonda Lee, author of Jade City How humanity came to the planet called Anjiin is lost in the fog of history, but that history is about to end. The Carryx – part empire, part hive – have waged wars of conquest for centuries, destroying or enslaving species across the galaxy. Now, they are facing a great and deathless enemy. The key to their survival may rest with the humans of Anjiin. Caught up in academic intrigue and affairs of the heart, Dafyd Alkhor is pleased just to be an assistant to a brilliant scientist and his celebrated research team. Then the Carryx ships descend, decimating the human population and taking the best and brightest of Anjiin society away to serve on the Carryx homeworld, and Dafyd is swept along with them. They are dropped in the middle of a struggle they barely understand, set in a competition against the other captive species with extinction as the price of failure. Only Dafyd and a handful of his companions see past the Darwinian contest to the deeper game that they must play to survive: learning to understand – and manipulate – the Carryx themselves. With a noble but suicidal human rebellion on one hand and strange and murderous enemies on the other, the team pays a terrible price to become the trusted servants of their new rulers. Dafyd Alkhor is a simple man swept up in events that are beyond his control and more vast than his imagination. He will become the champion of humanity and its betrayer, the most hated man in history and the guardian of his people. This is where his story begins. \"Corey is always one of the most engaging voices in the genre.\" ― Adrian Tchaikovsky, author of Children of Time \"A bang up read. I want more.\" ― Paolo Bacigalupi, author of The Water Knife \"A powerful, provocative masterpiece that I will be thinking about for a very long time.\" ― Ryka Aoki, author of Light from Uncommon Stars",

This is a time of change; humanity has witnessed the dream of the Emperor’s Great Crusade unravel, and from their perspective, it’s all the fault of the Legions.The Traitor Warmaster is dead. Terra lies in ruins. The Emperor is silent. Amid the rubble of the Palace, shell-shocked survivors emerge into the light of an uncertain dawn. New powers are present now, ones that have travelled the length of the galaxy to bring salvation to the Imperium, though they are as readily cast as usurpers as redeemers. The survivors of Horus’ Grand Armada, now scattered and desperate to escape vengeance, are riven with doubt and dissension, and their gods too are silent. Amid all the grief and confusion, some hopeful souls believe the war to be over and an era of renewal just ahead. But wiser heads know that this war can never end, and that the only question remaining is who shall rise to power within the perilous new age, and who shall fall.",

  "bookDescription": "Having made a miraculous recovery from the grevious injuries he suffered on Davin, Warmaster Horus now leads the triumphant Imperial forces against the rebel world of Isstvan III. An unprecedented alliance between the Sons of Horus, Death Guard, World Eaters and Emperor' Children Legions seems more than capable of overwhelming the paltry mortal defences - indeed, such a display of force seems unneccesary? Putting their own concerns aside, Garviel Loken and his loyal kinsmen lead their companies to the surface only to learn the full, horrifying truth, and the legendary war known as the Horus Heresy begins with the most foul act of betrayal imaginable...",

  "bookDescription": "In space, the real adventure starts after the warranty expires.Rix Banner just wants three things out of life: a working coffeemaker, a ship that doesn’t try to kill him, and maybe—just maybe—a full night of sleep without someone pounding on his hatch asking for “one tiny repair.” Naturally, he gets none of them.Between duct-taping patched coolant lines, arguing with an ancient navigation computer, and wrangling Patience Station’s maintenance headaches, Rix can barely keep ahead of the chaos. His shop is overflowing with broken photonic barrier generators, impounded cruisers, and a growing list of “favors” he apparently owes half the station.And that’s before the jobs go sideways.A routine cargo run turns into a mechanical nightmare involving exploding coffee, structural rot, and a ship held together by sheer stubbornness. Amari’s past keeps knocking on the door—sometimes with warrants—and Kel keeps disappearing on risky deliveries that somehow never go to plan. As trouble mounts, Rix finds himself neck-deep in station politics, pirate fallout, suspicious law enforcement, and a whole lot of equipment that definitely did not come with instructions.Fast, funny, and fueled by equal parts chaos and caffeine, Jump Drives and Coffee Stains cranks the wrench harder, flies faster, and doubles down on the blue-collar, grease-stained heroics that made Boltguns and Duct Tape an instant favorite.Strap in for a laugh-out-loud sci-fi ride—get your copy now!",

It was possibly part of an engine. After cleaning it up (it was found in a cow field), he placed the strange device on his dorm room desk directly over the wireless charging port. That woke it up.Unknown to him, the disabled starship hiding on the moon could now communicate with the missing part. The ship needed two things:1) The missing part.2) A crew to pass itself off as a manned ship (AIs were not supposed to control ships autonomously).Now, after finishing college, they need to find a way to get the ship to land somewhere safe, supply it, and return the missing component, the artifact.They suspect the most challenging part will be getting into space. They soon find that the real problem is what awaits them when they reach the alien trading center.",

Trazyn, a collector of historical oddities, presides over a gallery full of the most dangerous artefacts – and people – of the galactic past. Orikan, a chronomancer without peer, draws zodiacs that predict and manipulate the future. But when an artefact emerges that may hold the key to the necrons’ next evolution, these two obsessives enter a multi-millennia game of cat and mouse that ends civilisations, reshapes timelines, and changes both forever. As riddles unwind and ancient secrets are revealed, the question remains: will their feud save the necron race or destroy it?",

  "bookDescription": "A thrilling new novel based on the Paramount+ TV series Star Trek: Strange New Worlds!While patrolling the borders of the Klingon Empire, Captain Christopher Pike and the crew of the USS Enterprise record a series of subspace echoes from a planet orbiting a volatile flare star—and when Lieutenant Spock and Commander Una Chin-Riley lead a landing party to learn more, they discover the ruins of a dead civilization and evidence of starship-grade metals…quite possibly a crash site. As they continue to investigate the strange signals, Spock and Una find shocking signs of dangerous alien life and remnants of what can only be Federation hardware. The trail soon leads Pike andEnterprise’s helmswoman Lieutenant Erica Ortegas deep into the mystery of a lost Starfleet vessel, missing in action for over ninety years—and to a terrible dilemma that will challenge the crew to question their past...and their future.",

  "bookDescription": "The Berserkers forged him into a weapon. They’ve regretted it ever since.\nWhen Jack Ames fled the choking sprawl of his dystopian homeworld, he never meant to crash-land in the Berserker Corps—the galaxy’s deadliest mercenary outfit. But he found a new home. Strapped into a 135-ton gravtank or leading a power-suited grunt platoon, Ames is a tactical savant and a fearless warrior, turning battlefields into his personal canvas of chaos. Off-duty, his benders and bedroom conquests are stuff of Corps legend, rivaled only by the cataclysmic hangovers the morning after.\nTrouble is Ames sucks at blind obedience. Clueless officers, light-years from the shrapnel storm, bark orders that bleed good soldiers dry fast. So he shreds the playbook, launching audacious, seat-of-the-pants maneuvers that snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. His troopers hail him as a hero; the top brass brands him a cancer, stripping rank, slamming cell doors, and shuffling him through endless reassignments in a haze of court martials and office hours. Through it all, Ames grapples with the mirror: gifted soldier or architect of his own ruin?\nThe Berserkers want him gone. But Ames fights dirty—on the field and off. Love him or loathe him, demote him or decorate him; he’ll get the job done or die trying.\nOrders be damned!\nFrom USA Today Bestseller Ryan W. Aslesen comes a blistering military sci‑fi novel that plunges readers into the chaos of futuristic warfare, where defiance can be as deadly as the enemy’s guns.\nPart of the critically acclaimed Berserkers series, Orders Be Damned is a riveting standalone novel set in the gritty War’s Edge universe. Each book in the series is written so readers can dive into the action at any point. If you’re a fan of Hammer’s Slammers, Old Man’s War, or Starship Troopers, this is the book for you.\nWarning: This book is intended for a mature audience. Reader discretion is advised.",

  "bookDescription": "“There is nobody who does [military SF] better than Marko Kloos. His Frontlines series is a worthy successor to such classics as Starship Troopers, The Forever War, and We All Died at Breakaway Station.” —George R. R. Martin\nThe year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements: You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world . . . or you can join the service.\nWith the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price . . . and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.\nThe debut novel from Marko Kloos, Terms of Enlistment is an addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi.\nRevised edition: This edition of  Terms of Enlistment  includes editorial revisions.",

Fifteen hundred years ago, it declared its independence from the Imperium of Man, and paid the price. One loyal soul defied its treacherous rulers, and laid the world to waste. From these ashes emerged a unique fighting force, forged and tempered in nuclear fire…  Today, the Death Korps of Krieg lay siege to a captured hive city on the outskirts of the system-spanning Octarius War, in a desperate attempt to secure the cordon that stops untold masses of orks and tyranids from spilling out into the Imperium at large. The Korpsmen are relentless, ruthless, implacable and unstoppable, even in the face of a war that seems unwinnable. How far will they go to achieve victory, and is history doomed to repeat itself?",

  "bookDescription": "Being a sentient spaceship really should be more fun. But after spreading out through space for almost a century, Bob and his clones just can't stay out of trouble. They've created enough colonies so humanity shouldn't go extinct. But political squabbles have a bad habit of dying hard, and the Brazilian probes are still trying to take out the competition. And the Bobs have picked a fight with an older, more powerful species with a large appetite and a short temper. Still stinging from getting their collective butts kicked in their first encounter with the Others, the Bobs now face the prospect of a decisive final battle to defend Earth and its colonies. But the Bobs are less disciplined than a herd of cats, and some of the younger copies are more concerned with their own local problems than defeating the Others. Yet salvation may come from an unlikely source. A couple of eighth-generation Bobs have found something out in deep space. All it will take to save the Earth and perhaps all of humanity is for them to get it to Sol — unless the Others arrive first.",

  "bookDescription": "We were fighting on the wrong side, of a war we couldn't win. And that was the good news. The Ruhar hit us on Columbus Day. There we were, innocently drifting along the cosmos on our little blue marble, like the native Americans in 1492. Over the horizon come ships of a technologically advanced, aggressive culture, and BAM! There go the good old days, when humans only got killed by each other. So, Columbus Day. It fits. When the morning sky twinkled again, this time with Kristang starships jumping in to hammer the Ruhar, we thought we were saved. The UN Expeditionary Force hitched a ride on Kristang ships to fight the Ruhar, wherever our new allies thought we could be useful. So, I went from fighting with the US Army in Nigeria, to fighting in space. It was lies, all of it. We shouldn't even be fighting the Ruhar, they aren't our enemy, our allies are. I'd better start at the beginning....A selection of scenes from Columbus Day:There was a faint click, and the other door popped open a quarter inch. Cautiously, I pulled it open and stuck my head in. Beyond the door was a warehouse, maybe fifty feet by thirty, twenty feet tall, filled with racks of what I thought was mostly old, useless, dirty, dusty broken junk. I wandered in cautiously. Why the Ruhar had made the effort to store any of it made no sense to me. Surely there had to be something in there that I could use as a weapon.A man’s voice, with a snarky attitude, rang out behind me. “Excellent! Bipedal, 1300cc brain, opposable thumbs. A hairless monkey. You can carry me out of here.”I spun around in a panic. No one was there. “Who said that?”“Me. Here, I’m the shiny cylinder on the shelf. I unlocked that door.\"“You are? You mean you’re talking to me through a speaker in that thing?”“No, I am that thing. I am what you monkeys call an artificial intelligence.”I cocked my head and examined it skeptically. “You look like a chrome-plated beer can.\" That was a completely accurate description. The cylinder even tapered slightly at the top, and was ringed by a ridge. \"You’re really an AI?\"\"Yup. You should refer to me as The Lord God Almighty.”“That position is already filled. I think I’ll call you Skippy.”“Don’t call me that, it sounds disrespectful, monkey.”“You prefer shithead? Because that’s the other option, Skippy-O.” I kept glancing around, fearing the Ruhar would hear me.“Can we compromise on The Great and Powerful Oz?” It asked.“I’m not a flying monkey, so that’s a no, Skippy.”“Unacceptable.”“How about we go for something more formal, like Skippy McSkippster?”“No.”“Skippy Skipperson? Skippy Skippkowski? Skippy Von Skipping? Or maybe Sir Skippy Skippton-Skippersworth?”“No, no, no and NO!”“I can go on like this all day.”“I believe you could.”\"What you got?\" Ski asked.Cornpone winked. \"Uh, let's see. Damn! I got a gen-u-ine smorgasbord of Hooah! bars.\"\"A smorgasbord?\" I asked skeptically. \"Really?\"\"Oh yeah, a smorgasbord at least. Could be a plethora, maybe even, oooh, an honest to God, gosh-darned corn-u-copia of snack foods.\" It was funny to hear Jesse say 'plethora' in his deep southern accent.\"Cut the bullshit, man, you're making me hungry.\" Ski protested. \"What flavors you got in there?\"\"Well, I got Cinnamon Cardboard, of course, also Raisins 'n' Gravel, and, my personal fave, Original Sawdust.\"Crap. I got stuck with Raisin 'n' Gravel. The raisins were harder to chew than the gravel.“Space combat sounds complicated.” I thought back to when I’d listened to the Chicken pilot talk about air combat after our first war game, on Camp Alpha.“Uh huh. Then there’s the Skippy factor.”Part of me wanted to avoid taking the bait. “The Skippy factor?”“You know, my incredible awesomeness.”",

  "bookDescription": "The Bedlam Galaxy lies at the heart of the Laniakea Supercluster and is a focal point for all of the wormhole transits spanning that great expanse. Among the many races drawn to and inhabiting its 10,000+ stars, humanity is one of the most recent and longest anticipated additions. Once nearly driven to the brink of extinction by violent and irreconcilable gender divides within the dominant cultures of their homeworld, new technologies emerged to save the species from their own folly and helped propel them into a new age of interstellar exploration. Inevitably, that drive into the stars led to the discovery of their own wormhole transit at the edge of the solar system, and from there they ran straight into the waiting arms of Bedlam's great multi-species intergalactic trade and defense alliance, known colloquially as the Alliant.Vahkis Greye was born a century after those treaties were signed, but such lofty things held little interest to the son of a poor asteroid miner and his synthetic companion. All Greye wanted out of life was to make enough coin to open his own service and repair shop somewhere in the galactic rim, where his talents were really needed and would be appreciated. No more bouncing between odd jobs on far-star space stations, outer-system asteroid mines, and deep space hauler lanes. He wanted a place he could call home, and after two decades of scrimping and saving every last coin he earned, he finally had just enough for tuition to an accredited Systems Repair Tech simulatorium and the rare and expensive Adjustable Hard Light Projection multi-tool required to complete it. Degree in one hand, A.H.L.P in the other, Greye thought he might finally have a shot at his dream.Unfortunately, the universe had other plans.An unexpected early-morning service call from one Captain Rita Mari of the Prison Ship Sheol arrived with an offer he literally couldn't refuse. Within hours the unlucky technician found himself alone and trapped aboard an un-crewed and mortally damaged Megalith Class Supercarrier surrounded by violent gangs of murderous female inmates, hounded by a genocidal race of alien shock troopers, demonized and hunted by his own kind, and welcome pretty much nowhere within the galactic spiral.All he'd ever wanted was to be left alone with his reasonable little dream of repairing the space ships he'd always found so interesting. Instead, fate threw him into a situation so absurd even a life-long survivor of the worst hives of scum and villainy the Rim had to offer cannot see a way out of it.At least not without help.Be forewarned! In addition to bawdy action-filled adventures, criminal hijinks, and the occasional exploration of dark and heavy topics, this series contains depictions of alien morality and cultural norms, as well as relationships that could be considered non-traditional... you know, for humans.",

To save his life, the ship’s own biomatter must replace his failing cells.\nNow , Noah is different.

And as he does, he discovers a looming threat in the far reaches of space, growing in power, and set on capturing Noah and his ship.\nWorse still, this new enemy knows about Earth. . . and it has big plans.",

  "bookDescription": "The Bedlam Galaxy lies at the heart of the Laniakea Supercluster and is a focal point for all of the wormhole transits spanning that great expanse. Among the many races drawn to and inhabiting its 10,000+ stars, humanity is one of the most recent and longest anticipated additions. Once nearly driven to the brink of extinction by violent and irreconcilable gender divides within the dominant cultures of their homeworld, new technologies emerged to save the species from their own folly and helped propel them into a new age of interstellar exploration. Inevitably, that drive into the stars led to the discovery of their own wormhole transit at the edge of the solar system, and from there they ran straight into the waiting arms of Bedlam's great multi-species intergalactic trade and defense alliance, known colloquially as the Alliant.Having been coerced to board the all female maximum-security galactic prison ship known as the Sheol in order to perform one vital repair, Vahkis Greye has so far managed to survive dozens of potentially lethal incidents. He has faced constant attempts on his life by marauding aliens, homicidal inmates, out-of-control robots, and even his own government. And if that wasn't enough, the ship itself is coming down around him. Singularity core failures, multiple hull breaches, an overloaded computer core, a mysteriously absent ship's AI, and rapidly dwindling supplies are just a few of the legion of threats that could have potentially snuffed out all life onboard the ship.So clearly, it's been a rough couple of days.But Greye is also no longer alone. Phyra Astarte, the lone surviving shock trooper of the ashtor fleet that attacked the Sheol now stands at his side, lending him her considerable strength as well as her optimism for the future. The mad Alexandra twins work day and night in their medical lab to ostensibly aid him in his efforts, though they clearly have machinations of their own in the works. Reverie Pixi, a thief and burglar of the notoriously soft-fingered and fox-like skipp race, who has the genetic ability to bend and manipulate light around her body, and of course, the ever-distracting Lilia Namaah, eishethi leader of the largest remaining gang on the ship. They, along with a genetically modified Alliant pilot and a nameless trace girl found within a hellish unmarked cell in the bowels of the ship, have joined him in his fight to survive all that the galaxy has to throw at them.But perhaps the most direct threat of all has been lurking within the armored walls of the Sheol since the very first shot was fired and now, with the ship's most vital functions all but secured, it has begun to move against them. Pursued from within and without, Greye and his companions must find a way to solidify their control over the Sheol, or the end that awaits them will truly be the stuff of nightmares.",

  "bookDescription": "From the author of the amazon best selling Empire Rising series comes a new epic saga.For over two millennia, humanity has lived under the unyielding peace of the Human Republic. Born from the ashes of a devastating revolt, the Republic vowed to prevent the nuclear holocaust of another interstellar war at any cost. Its inner core worlds—thirteen powerful colonies—maintain an iron grip over the thousands of outlying planets humanity has settled.But peace has come at a price.Two and a half thousand years of centralized rule, greed, and corruption have all but enslaved those who live outside the Republic’s inner core. For the citizens of these rim worlds, freedom is a distant dream—a relic buried in humanity’s past.Yet what has been buried cannot be hidden forever.For those who strive for these long lost ideals, they will soon discover what so many before them have learnt the hard way – freedom always comes at a cost.For Second Lieutenant Caleb Hawthorne, the cost will be higher than he can imagine. When a secessionist movement arises, Caleb must choose between the navy he has dedicated his life to and his loyalty to family and homeworld. As the tyranny of his masters becomes clearer, there is only one choice. But can he learn the ways of war fast enough to make a difference? And can he throw off the ties that bind him to the Republic so easily?Freedom, family, and love are powerful rallying cries, but can they inspire a people to accomplish what no one has done in nearly three thousand years— to forge a nation of their own?Embers of Rebellion is the first novel in the Secession Wars series by D. J. Holmes that will tell the sweeping story of the Rim's quest for freedom from the Republic and all the war, loss, and devestation that will arise from a peoples' striving to be free.",

Welcome to humanity’s new war: silent, high stakes, and unseen. This is a life-or-death mission for the Office of Naval Intelligence’s black-ops team, Kilo-Five, which is tasked with preventing the ruthless Sangheili, once the military leaders of the alien alliance known as the Covenant, from regrouping and threatening humankind again. What began as a routine dirty-tricks operation—keeping the Sangheili occupied with their own insurrection—turns into a desperate bid to extract one member of Kilo-Five from the seething heart of a brutal civil war. But troubles never come singly for Kilo-Five. Colonial terrorism is once again surfacing on one of the human worlds that survived the war against the Covenant, and the man behind it is much more than just a name to Spartan Naomi-010.

  "bookDescription": "Physics doesn’t negotiate. Neither does she.\nTwelve years ago, a Polish colony found an alien warship in a debris field. Now every superpower in human space wants what they reverse-engineered.\nOn the frontier, Polonia Prime is a small, underfunded nation with one unforgivable advantage: hybrid alien drive and weapons technology that can rewrite every fleet doctrine in the Hyades Cluster.\nLieutenant Commander Maria Roszak earned her command through tactical competence, not bloodline or politics. Her destroyer Błyskawica is a relic on the outside, retrofitted inside with forbidden Bubble-drive systems, railgun batteries, and point-defense grids that skate the edge of physics. When a Zenith Caliphate carrier strike group crosses the border to seize Polonia’s secrets, Maria finds herself outnumbered, outgunned—and no longer sure her own side is playing straight.\nEvery time the enemy finds her faster than they should, suspicion grows. If she’s right about a leak in her own chain of command, exposing it could destroy her career and her ship long before the Caliphate does. To keep her crew alive and her nation independent, Maria must turn debris fields into weapons, doctrine into a disadvantage, and an obsolete destroyer into the sharpest blade in Polonia’s arsenal.\nIn a battlespace where Newtonian recoil, delta-v budgets, and railgun kinetics decide who lives, one captain’s brain is the only shield her people have left.\nFor readers who love:\nHard-science military space opera with real-physics combat (Bubble-drive micro-jumps, railguns, missiles, point defense, no magic)\nHard-science military space opera with real-physics combat (Bubble-drive micro-jumps, railguns, missiles, point defense, no magic)\nUnderdog nations, carrier strike groups, and destroyer-captain tactics under political pressure\nUnderdog nations, carrier strike groups, and destroyer-captain tactics under political pressure\nCompetent female officers, gritty tone, and respect for military professionalism\nCompetent female officers, gritty tone, and respect for military professionalism\nSeries like The Lost Fleet and The Expanse, where brains matter more than bigger guns\nSeries like The Lost Fleet and The Expanse, where brains matter more than bigger guns",

The far-off colony of New Svalbard, cut off from the rest of the galaxy by the Lanky blockade, teeters on the verge of starvation and collapse. The forces of the two Earth alliances have won minor skirmishes but are in danger of losing the war. For battle-weary staff sergeant Andrew Grayson and the ragged forces of the North American Commonwealth, the fight for survival is entering a catastrophic new phase.\nForging an uneasy alliance with their Sino-Russian enemies, the NAC launches a hybrid task force on a long shot: a stealth mission to breach the Lanky blockade and reestablish supply lines with Earth. Plunging into combat against a merciless alien species that outguns, outmaneuvers, and outfights them at every turn, Andrew and his fellow troopers could end up cornered on their home turf, with no way out and no hope for reinforcement. And this time, the struggle for humanity’s future can only end in either victory or annihilation.",

As one of the few to escape the glassing of Paris IV, and despite the United Nations Space Command winning the war on behalf of humanity, Molly never forgot how much she had lost. Nine years later, when her adoptive parents—research scientists specializing in ancient Forerunner technology—are called to the mysterious and wondrous place known as Onyx, Molly vehemently objects. It’s not so much that Molly’s concerned about relocating to inside a spherical construct the diameter of an entire solar system, but the fact that she also has to live alongside members of the same alien species that murdered her family. And when the Servants of the Abiding Truth—a violent ex-Covenant sect under the guidance of the notorious Pale Blade—somehow makes its way inside this supposedly impregnable sphere, Molly is now forced to consider if she and her new parents have made a terrible and fatal mistake in coming here....",

  "bookDescription": "With his new rank, secrets begin to unfold for Van as war and politics become one and the same. The Fafnir is no longer a mere ship—it’s a force to be reckoned with, but it isn’t complete.One possible answer lies in deep space, in a secret facility funded by an array of allies. But this laboratory creates something far more deadly than a virus or a weapon.It produces ships.Null Stellarium is more than a shipyard. It’s a proving ground, steeped with science and engineering designed to push warships faster than ever before, and armed to confront the growing menace of a universe where everything is influenced by a hidden evil.As Van and his crew grow into their new roles, Perry unlocks a memory that reaches into the very beginning of the Tudor family’s service, nearly a century earlier.But sometimes, the truth is hidden for a reason, and Van must decide—How much does he really want to know? And how far can he take his ship, knowing there’s a price on his head?",

Clarke award-winning author of Children of Time brings us the second novel in an extraordinary space opera trilogy about humanity on the brink of extinction, and how one man's discovery will save or destroy us all. After eighty years of fragile peace, the Architects are back, wreaking havoc as they consume entire planets. In the past, Originator artefacts – vestiges of a long-vanished civilization – could save a world from annihilation. This time, the Architects have discovered a way to circumvent these protective relics. Suddenly, no planet is safe.Facing impending extinction, the Human Colonies are in turmoil. While some believe a unified front is the only way to stop the Architects, others insist humanity should fight alone. And there are those who would seek to benefit from the fractured politics of war – even as the Architects loom ever closer.Idris, who has spent decades running from the horrors of his past, finds himself thrust back onto the battlefront. As an Intermediary, he could be one of the few to turn the tide of war. With a handful of allies, he searches for a weapon that could push back the Architects and save the galaxy. But to do so, he must return to the nightmarish unspace, where his mind was broken and remade.What Idris discovers there will change everything.",

In mere minutes, half the human race died, and our cities lay in shattered ruins.But the Shongairi didn’t expect the survivors’ tenacity. And, crucially, they didn’t know that Earth harbored two species of intelligent, tool-using bipeds. One of them was us. The other, long-lived and lethal, was hiding in the mountains of eastern Europe, the subject of fantasy and legend.

  "bookDescription": "\"Move over, Kirk and Spock—Quintos and Pristy are my new favorite space heroes!\"\n—Melissa Patterson, ARC reader\nCaptain Galvin Quintos commands humanity's most advanced battle group in a desperate mission to the galaxy's edge, where the Techno-Mycoids have returned with unprecedented force. This fungal-mechanical species, previously encountered in smaller numbers, now fields massive fleets systematically consuming the peaceful Zephyrian civilization. With thirty-six billion souls already assimilated into their grotesque bio-mechanical war machine, time is running out for both the Zephyrians and potentially all organic life in the galaxy.Armed with cutting-edge omninought-class warships and thousands of DreadBots equipped with experimental sesquiterpene weapons, the fleet faces impossible mathematical odds. The enemy's hive-mind intelligence seems to anticipate every tactical move, suggesting they possess foreknowledge that shouldn't be possible.Captain Gail Pristy commands the battle group's oldest and most vulnerable vessel while navigating her complicated romantic history with Quintos. Their personal relationship becomes secondary to survival when a catastrophic malfunction in the ship's recreational systems unleashes a deadly pathogen that transforms artificial beings into ravenous killing machines.Sonya Winters, Quintos's brilliant eighteen-year-old niece and MIT student, finds herself at the center of the crisis. Her deep understanding of the ship's biological systems—and her complicated friendship with the Pleidian officer responsible for the outbreak—forces her to make devastating choices that could either doom or save humanity.As infected creatures spread chaos throughout the fleet, temporal anomalies caused by the enigmatic time-traveler General Resnick create critical blind spots in the enemy's perfect coordination. In a final confrontation spanning multiple realities, an accidental biological weapon becomes humanity's unexpected salvation against seemingly invincible foes, proving that sometimes victory emerges from the most catastrophic failures.Reviews:-USS Battlestrike is military science fiction at its finest. Mark Wayne McGinnis delivers an action-packed space opera that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. If you love space fleet battles and galactic empire intrigue, this is a must-read.-KP-Mark Wayne McGinnis has crafted another winner with USS Battlestrike. This installment takes the military science fiction genre to new heights with its intricate space fleet maneuvers and the ever-present threat of alien invasion.

Now, listeners will discover how it all began—not only for John “Black Jack” Geary and his descendant Commander Michael Geary, but for those who fought and sacrificed so much alongside them.\nSpanning from before the Alliance/Syndicate war to the devastating initial conflagration that would lead to decades of unremitting conflict and beyond into full-blown war, from the Geary’s own epic heroics to where their surviving compatriots found their own fates, this volume reveals the triumphs, tragedies, and life-altering events that made these warriors living legends in their universe.\nPacked with high-stakes military action and drama as well as humor and humanity, this volume explores the foundations of The Lost Fleet series as well as past exploits of its most popular characters—and also includes the novelization of the Lost Fleet graphic novel Corsair, which was praised as “a Tom Clancy thriller in space” (Publishers Weekly).",

But that’s not in the particular hand they’ve been dealt. On their way to Alpha Four to make Emperor Alexander feel like he hasn’t been left out, Kitty and eleven others are tossed into a different universe at the snap of some very powerful fingers.They’re not sent to just any universe, either. They’re in the Steampunk Universe and things are very different there – and not just due to the technological divergence between Kitty’s universe and this one. Starting with them being surrounded by ships that are redefining the term “unfriendly” – because this universe has been embroiled in galactic war for centuries.Friends are enemies, enemies are friends, people alive in one universe are dead in this one and vice versa is old news for Kitty, but new news for everyone else with her. The Victorian Era still reigns supreme here, meaning everyone’s attitudes are a lot less free and easy than Kitty’s used to.But the biggest discovery is the worst one – instead of being Kitty’s husband and a total hero, the Jeff Martini in this universe is an evil murderer who’s aligned his entire empire with the Z’porrah, and that means the good guys are losing...",

Their only hope is a man who’s emerged from a century-long hibernation to find he has been heroically idealized beyond belief…\nCaptain John “Black Jack” Geary’s legendary exploits are known to every schoolchild. Revered for his heroic “last stand” in the early days of the war, he was presumed dead. But a century later, Geary miraculously returns from survival hibernation and reluctantly takes command of the Alliance fleet as it faces annihilation by the Syndics.\nAppalled by the hero-worship around him, Geary is nevertheless a man who will do his duty. And he knows that bringing the stolen Syndic hypernet key safely home is the Alliance’s one chance to win the war. But to do that, Geary will have to live up to the impossibly heroic “Black Jack” legend…",

Stripping osmium from across the stars, thieves will stop at nothing to fuel the nightmarish industry of Stolen Persons, their souls locked away in chips made of the rarest metal known.Among these thieves is Helum Gauss, the visionary criminal whose empire spans a hundred worlds. But his massive corporation, BeneStar, lost—badly—to Van and the Guild, and Gauss won’t take no for an answer.To that end, he’ll hit Van where it hurts the most.Family.Lost among the Stolen Persons, Carter Yost is far from home, angry, and spoiling for a fight, and BeneStar is the perfect method for revenge on Van, the Guild, and the forces of justice. To BeneStar CEO Helem Gauss, murder isn’t a crime. It’s just part of doing business, and with a trillion bonds at stake, Gauss declares war on anyone who stands in his way of absolute authority.BeneStar tried guns. They tried missiles. They tried galactic media, and they still lost. Now, they’ll use an enraged soul captured between life and death, and one last weapon that frightens employees everywhere. The Human Resource Department.Gauss will unleash his most vicious division of bureaucrats -- and a league of attorneys whose sole job is to crush opponents by any means necessary. BeneStar will fight in court, in the public forum, or in the depths of space, where laws and missiles can end a Peacemaker’s career forever. The mercenaries and pirates, all armed to the teeth, are an added bonus for BeneStar, whose navy ranks among the most powerful in known space.In a war for control of the hearts and minds of everyone in The Deeps, Van and his crew are going to win— or die trying.",

The Earth is about to meet aliens. Some of the aliens are bringing goods to trade. And among those items—are weapons.When a secret cabal of humans who want to exploit the Earth is revealed, Van has to decide how and where to fight this threat. Along the way, he reveals a secret history that began in the Great War—and ends with mass chaos on his home planet.Van won’t let that happen—at least not without a fight, and to hold back the gears of war, he’s going to need a lot of help. With Torina at his side, the crew faces a decision that will change the future of the stars themselves, and challenge the Guild, the Earth, and the Equal Grasp as the universe gets smaller with each contact between humans and aliens.How can Van manage the clash, save earth, and deliver peace?If he can, what will it cost him?",

But when the fleet was violently and unexpectedly thrown off course, the colonists found themselves trapped in an unexplored region of the galaxy—and caught right in the middle of a bloody interstellar war.\nNow, after generations of relentless fighting, a tentative truce has finally ushered in an era of growth and prosperity. Yet as hardline forces on all sides conspire to break the ceasefire, humanity finds itself in need of a new type of soldier—one who can win the peace even while the galaxy arms for war.\nMajor Kal Zeris is the next generation of Dominion trooper, a powerful psionic soldier capable of withstanding—and dishing out—superhuman amounts of punishment. Born naturally on a crime-infested border world, Kal has learned to do whatever it takes to survive. But when he finds himself paired up with a sheltered young fleet cadet, he quickly learns that despite what her flawless, genetically engineered body may have given her in looks and smarts, there is no replacement for good, old-fashioned experience—on the battlefield or in the bedroom. And luckily for her, Kal is eager and willing to help with both.\nTogether, they must unravel a conspiracy that threatens to end the peace—and destroy the Lost Fleet before it can find its way home.",

His mission is a dual one, for he is also simultaneously the new Regional Governor of the scattered Imperial colonies there...a position that has never existed before.That's because the Frontier is a trash heap, and the Fleet stationed in it a collection of older ships with crews comprised of officers that the rest of the Empire didn't want. They're cast-offs exiled to die in service far from their homes in wars against numerous alien races that refuse to bend the knee to the Empire's continual expansion.Embarrassed and frustrated at the lack of progress, the Emperor turns to Aatroxiss, a known enemy of the Empire, and makes a deal to do what his own military commanders cannot...Bring order to the Frontier.So now Aatroxiss, hated by the Empire's propaganda machine in the minds of the military and civilians alike, must take command of a broken fleet and use his strategic mastery to begin mending the Frontier and preparing for a rumored invasion that the Emperor fears from beyond.Oh, and he also plans to overthrow the Empire when the time is right. That's pretty much out in the air between the two men, but for the moment their goals intersect and they reluctantly agree to work together for the benefit of the colonies in the Frontier.After that, all bets are off...",

Gunnery Sergeant Edward Buck and his team of Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODSTs) played a major role in saving Earth from all-out invasion at the end of the Covenant War―acts of bravery and ingenuity that did not go unnoticed by the United Nations Space Command. Now, after many Spartans have been killed in battle and the Master Chief is listed as MIA, the UNSC decides to create a new generation of Spartans to defend humanity from threats both outside―and within. When they come to Buck with an extraordinary proposition, he is forced to make a life-altering decision. With the Covenant War finally over, is it time for him to retire to the sidelines for a life he could only dream about…or is he prepared to step up and become part of the military’s new blood?
