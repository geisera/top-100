        "reviewDescription": "*NON SPOILER REVIEW*Out of the 4 books that I have read of Denning, he always has good stories. The books as a whole almost always turn out to be a very good read. My only issue with Troy Denning's writing style (and this may just be me) is that I time and time again have issues in my minds eye visualizing the characters. Namely the directions that the characters are facing or where things are positioned. This may be a small complaint, especially since I say that his books are overall always good, but it does prove to disrupt the flow of the reading for me.With that being said, this book in particular was phenomenal in all of the right ways. To me, for those who watch anime, I would compare it similarly to how I have heard many compare One Piece to Naruto. Whereas Naruto focuses on individual plotlines and character development, One Piece lends more to world building. The Shadows of Reach spends a considerable time building the world in between and during  the missions, dialogue, and battle sequences. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The fall of Reach (Naruto) builds who the Spartans are. The Shadows of Reach (One Piece) returns to reach and builds up the world so to speak. obviously, you can say much more about the two but you get my drift.If I could add one more thing, read: Silent Storm, oblivion, Outcasts (standalone but to me is a sequel and necessary to fully appreciate Oblivion), then The shadows of Reach.",

        "reviewDescription": "Troy Denning has two of the three current threads of the Halo novels extended-universe. The first two \"A Master Chief\" stories occurred in a time in the Official Halo Timeline where John, Kelly, Fred, and Linda were teenagers, after Reach but before Halo: CE. Those felt like a retcon, but they didn't retcon anything, just added a story into the lore where there was a gap and/or no story (they put something in that really didn't need to be there since it was a past story and we already know how things played out, so it was self-contained and felt like a waste of time).This story, however, is after Last Light (so Fred has joined back up with his Blue Team group) and also after Halo 5: Guardians, and before Halo: Infinite. Unfortunately, H:I retcons this book in-that the game is the first time of Chief meeting Atriox and Escharum... in this book, however, the ending has Blue Team encountering Atriox and Escharum, including Master Chief, so it sorta felt like a letdown in the game that they ignored this book (like how Bungie ignored all the books in the original Halo trilogy).This book is great! Lots of exposition, and just the right amount of dialogue between Blue Team.",

Rapport picks up with A.R.T.'s crew and some scholars on a mission to a Corporate Rim Station to investigate some artifacts a section of the station rumored to be Pre-Corporate Rim.There is always danger when entering the CR for a mission and this is no exception. Iris needs to be on her game, but she's distracted. Something's been up with Peri since he came back from his last solo mission.Rapport is short, but it is mighty. I loved the further insight into the Corporates from Iris' perspective, seeing her and the crew on one of the missions ART told SecUnit about, and also seeing from the inside the relationship between Iris and ART. A fabulous interlude in the grand story arc.",

        "reviewTitle": "Teaser",
        "reviewDescription": "Reviewed on Good ReadsOne of Martha Wells' Murderbot fragments- very short stories that serve mostly as accents to the main series, rather than any major addition to it. The two previous story fragments were \"Home: Habitat; Range: Niche; Territory\" and \"The Future of Work: Compulsory \". They are all worth reading, imo, though frustratingly short.This one is not about Murderbot directly but centers on his friend ART and ART's crew, who we met in the last two novellas.. it's only 34 pages (e-book) but the story and writing are good enough that I wished it were a full blown novella or at least a real short story.ART and company are on another mission to mitigate the indentured servitude of the Corporate Rim, where hostile takeovers are *really* hostile.We get more details about the Corporate Rim and ART that provide context to the whole series but it's so brief that any plot discussion verges on spoiler territory.I liked it but it felt too much like a teaser to be really satisfying.",

    "bookDescription": "The Complete Series in a single offering!\nTwo centuries ago, the First Expansionary Fleet set off to the farthest reaches of the galaxy, hoping to explore, colonize, and conquer new worlds in the name of humanity. But when the fleet was violently and unexpectedly thrown off course, the colonists found themselves trapped in an unexplored region of the galaxy—and caught right in the middle of a bloody interstellar war.\nNow, after generations of relentless fighting, a tentative truce has finally ushered in an era of growth and prosperity. Yet as hardline forces on all sides conspire to break the ceasefire, humanity finds itself in need of a new type of soldier—one who can win the peace even while the galaxy arms for war.\nMajor Kal Zeris is the next generation of Dominion trooper, a powerful psionic soldier capable of withstanding—and dishing out—superhuman amounts of punishment. Born naturally on a crime-infested border world, Kal has learned to do whatever it takes to survive. But when he finds himself paired up with a sheltered young fleet cadet, he quickly learns that despite what her flawless, genetically engineered body may have given her in looks and smarts, there is no replacement for good, old-fashioned experience—on the battlefield or in the bedroom. And luckily for her, Kal is eager and willing to help with both.\nTogether, they must unravel a conspiracy that threatens to end the peace—and destroy the Lost Fleet before it can find its way home.",

    "bookDescription": "Book 7 of the global bestselling series, \"The Horus Heresy: Siege of Terra\".The walls have fallen. The defenders’ unity is broken. The Inner Palace lies in ruins. The Warmaster’s horde advances through the fire and ash of Terra’s dying breaths, forcing the loyalists back to the Delphic Battlement, the very walls of the Sanctum Imperialis. Angron, Herald of Horus, has achieved immortality through annihilation – now he leads the armies of the damned in a wrathful tide, destroying all before them as the warp begins its poisonous corruption of Terra. For the Emperor’s beleaguered forces, the end has come. The Khan lies on the edge of death. Rogal Dorn is encircled, fighting his own war at Bhab Bastion. Guilliman will not reach Terra in time. Without his brothers, Sanguinius – the Angel of the Ninth Legion – waits on the final battlements, hoping to rally a desperate band of defenders and refugees for one last stand.",

        "reviewDescription": "Book seven of the Siege of Terra and Aaron Dembski-Bowden delivers a sold footing for the final two books to finish on.  It is a sad and disheartening story for the most part with the Loyalists on their back foot for most of it. The breaching of the final defenses of the Imperial Palace and the final closing of the Eternity Gate.  Then in all the loss there is the melding of the loyalist forces into a stoic and lethal force.  Sanguinius' defeat of his demonic brother and Ka'banda are the best part.  Read it by all means.  If I had a real criticism for the book it is a bit long in some places.",

        "reviewDescription": "The author of this book, Aaron Dembski-Bowden has a track record of taking Warhammer lore to its full potential.  This is without a doubt his best novel, and has narrowly taken its place as my favorite Warhammer novel (of any of the settings), of all time.  The reality of a six month siege, with the absurd technological/metaphysical capabilities of other armies is pushed to maximum realism here.To be blunt, this book can be brutal.  There are scenes that are grotesque and tough to read but they always have a point.  Nonetheless, I ended this book feeling something.  Drained, hopeful, and haunted all at the same time.  This book is incredible.",

The grimmerdark gets a bit old, and I wish occasionally the bad guys would suffer a bit more for being bad.But. Then he writes something like this....AND TOTALLY REDEEMS HIMSELF. This novel feels like a living thing. It is heavy, I read it a chapter at a time because they were so brutal and real. If you ever thought that the followers of Chaos got off clear and free- well my friend you won't for long.The Blood Angels finally shine, if in a tragic and dark way. I want more from ADB on the Revenant Legion. The same characters we have been following (including the Howl of the Hearthworld) have their stories wrapped up, or some probably wished it was wrapped up.This novel deserves all the praise and credit it will get. ADB has outdone himself, and written what I would describe as a science fiction novel that anyone could read and love. Again, well done. I am completely impressed.",

        "reviewDescription": "What a shining jewel.What a splendid masterpiece.Saying that this book left me dumbfounded would be a dire understatement.Aaron crafted an outstanding volume and wove a story utterly captivating and poignant.He depicts in a breathtaking way one of the most tragic stages of the Heresy : the battle for the Eternity Gate.Aaron delivers golden information about the Blood Angels and Sanguinius (the ever tormented Angel).And also about the World Eaters, who they were and what they became.Despair is everywhere.Doom is dangerously looming like threatening clouds before a storm.Terra lies in tatters and mankind is aghast.No one would blame the survivors for giving up. They've already been holding on for so long.No more could and should be asked from them.But they hold on. They fight. With uniyelding defiance.Even though the outcome has already been decided by blood-thirsty monstrosities.Even though they're sorely outnumbered.They all fight. Astartes, humans, Primarchs.And the result is quite simply epic.If there was just one book of The Siege of Terra series you should read fellas, that's definitely this one.I cannot recommend that book enough.Don't straggle guys !!PS : seeing Sanguinius kicking Angron's sorry butt is absolutely priceless!",

    "bookDescription": "The Alliance has been fighting the Syndics for a century—and losing badly. Now its fleet is crippled and stranded in enemy territory. Their only hope is a man who’s emerged from a century-long hibernation to find he has been heroically idealized beyond belief…\nCaptain John “Black Jack” Geary’s legendary exploits are known to every schoolchild. Revered for his heroic “last stand” in the early days of the war, he was presumed dead. But a century later, Geary miraculously returns from survival hibernation and reluctantly takes command of the Alliance fleet as it faces annihilation by the Syndics.\nAppalled by the hero-worship around him, Geary is nevertheless a man who will do his duty. And he knows that bringing the stolen Syndic hypernet key safely home is the Alliance’s one chance to win the war. But to do that, Geary will have to live up to the impossibly heroic “Black Jack” legend…",

        "reviewDescription": "Dauntless (2006) is the first naval SF novel in The Lost Fleet series.  Sometime in the mid future, the Syndicate Worlds attacked the Alliance without warning.  Their first attack was against an Alliance convoy in the Grendel system commanded by \"Black Jack\" Geary.  The escorts delayed the attackers long enough for most of the convoy to escape.Commander Geary stayed behind on his crippled ship while his crew fled in escape pods.  He then scuttled the ship and ejected in a damaged escape pod, going into life suspension.  A century later, his pod was found by an Alliance fleet moving through the system to attack the Syndic home world.In this novel, Jack Geary is a captain by posthumous promotion.  He is now the most senior captain in the Alliance.  Unfortunately, he is also trapped within his own legend.Tanya Desjani is an Alliance Captain, commanding the Dauntless.  Her ship is Admiral Bloch's flagship.  She is younger than Geary expects of a battle cruiser commander, but the attrition rate in the Alliance navy has resulted in young ship captains.Numos is an Alliance Captain, commanding the battleship Orion.  He is thoroughly indoctrinated with the current naval customs of courage and aggression.Victoria Rione is the Co-president of the Callas Republic and a member of the Alliance Senate.  She is the only civilian within the fleet.In this story, Geary has been on the Dauntless for only a short time.  Then the fleet encounters an ambush in the Syndic system and is quite soundly defeated.  Admiral Bloch designates Geary as the acting fleet commander before leaving for the Syndic flagship to negotiate terms of surrender.Later, the Alliance fleet receives a video showing Admiral Bloch and the other senior officers being executed.  The Syndic CEO states that their surrender must be unconditional.  Then he gives them an hour to signal their capitulation.Geary calls a virtual captains conference to discuss the situation.  First there is a spirited debate about his role in the fleet.  After establishing his appointment as fleet commander, Geary tries to steer the discussion into ways of responding to the surrender demand.Captain Numos asserts that the only choices are attack or submit.  Geary points out that the system jump point is unguarded.  The ship captains insist that the jump point is useless to them, but Geary issues orders to stall while the slower ships drift toward the jump point.Geary asks Senator Rione to negotiate surrender terms.  She manages to draw out the negotiations for an hour and Geary gains another half hour.  Then the Syndic ships start moving toward the Alliance fleet.The commander of the Repulse is a grandnephew of Geary.  He has had his nose rubbed into the \"Black Jack\" Geary mythos and hates the legend.  Yet he offers to delay the pursuit and falls behind the rest of the fleet.The Repulse takes out the fastest pursuers before being destroyed.  The remaining Alliance ships make it through the jump point without further losses.  Once into jumpspace, the ships have some time for internal repairs, but intership communications are greatly limited.After reaching the Corvus system, the Alliance fleet finds the system defenses have not been reinforced.  Although bases and warships are located in the system, the jump point has not been mined.  Geary leaves two battle cruiser squadrons at the jump point to guard against any pursuit.This tales takes the Lost Fleet further into Syndic territory, trying to avoid obvious choke points.  Geary relieves one captain for his reckless actions.  Numos and his supporters argue against every move that Geary makes, but other captains are beginning to learn old tactics and skills that were forgotten during the past century.Despite rumors initiated by Numos, the Lost Fleet begins to respect Geary.  The next installment in this series is Fearless.This series is written by John G. Hemry, who is better known for his Stark and JAG in Space books.  The current series may be the best yet.  So why did the author use a pseudonym?Highly recommended for Hemry fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of naval strategy, space combat, and lonely commanders.  Read and enjoy!-Arthur W.

        "reviewDescription": "\"Dauntless\" The lost Fleet Book1 by Jack Campbell.A war has been raging across the stars between the Alliance and the Syndics for 100 years now. The Alliance officers do there best to honor the memory of their most sacred hero Captain John \"Black Jack\" Geary who during the early stages of the war held off a force of Syndics that badly out numbered his fleet long enough for most to escape until his ship was eventually destroyed. As far as the Alliance knows Geary went down with his ship however that isn't the case; Geary has been suspended in hibernation sleep in an escape pod for the past hundred years and has only now been discovered by the Alliance. Now Geary through a turn of events is placed in charge of a new fleet. One who for the most part reveres him as a god even though he knows he isn't. It is Geary's task to keep this fleet alive and return it to Alliance space. In the mean time he will have to  try to retrain and command a fleet who have lost most of the tactical fighting knowledge from Geary's time...\"Dauntless\" was a very good read but be forewarned that it is not for everyone. Although the story is set in the middle of a war there isn't a substantial amount of action and the battles that do take place are comparable to reading a chess match. The story is actually more about Captain Geary and his interaction with the fleet and watching him deal with his shipmates who think he is some unstoppable god of war from the past when he in fact knows that is not the case. The war takes place in the back ground for the most part and works as a plot device that drives Geary. The battles all take place in space between large fleets and there aren't any close quarters fights explored.The Good: The concept for the story was great in that it places this great hero of the past amidst the leaders of today and each is forced to examine the other. The history built for the Alliance and the fact that the reader is privy to the Geary's examinations of how things have changed is well done. Geary is the central and main character of the book and overall the character is well drawn.The Bad: For me nothing. For some this book will be boring. The book focuses mainly on one character and the story is mostly about his attempting to interact with and control and the fleet and the action that does take place is like reading a chess match. If you are looking for an action packed thrill ride this isn't the one for you.Overall: A great read. If the premise sounds interesting pick it up and give it a try.",

        "reviewDescription": "I thoroughly have enjoyed reading this series. if you followed from the beginning it's been fun to see how the author's writing ability and style mature as the series progressed. The writing in the first couple books was a bit slow. However quickly Campbell's confidence grows along with the main character's. You can really see the love he has for the service in this writing as well. The respect and tradition. As Capt. Geary brings back military tradition, the writing becomes lighter and happier. This is a great Sci Fi read, as well as people who love military action, and technical description. Campbell has obviously put a LOT of effort into the accuracy when describing space combat. I have read all but 3 books in the full series, and each one I enjoy more than the last. There are scenes where I find myself cheering out loud when the good guys snatch another victory from the jaws of defeat. Campbell is an amazing author. If you love drama, and Sci Fi, as well as military themed fiction, buy these books. I am also a fan of Patrick O'Brian's work, and this really does play into the same line as those novels. O'Brian's work is set in the distant past, while Campbell's work is in the distant future. I can see parallels between the two authors.Some reviewers have complained that Campbell has a tendency to repeatedly explain minor details, but this doesn't take you out of the story. This likely comes from the attention to detail that he gained with his military background.Over all, great read, great writing, great story. I LOVE these books.",

        "reviewDescription": "Earth is at war with the Syndic. Who are human just like you and me but take an entirely different perspective on what is right and wrong. What's right is anything that financially or politically benefits them. What's wrong is everything else.What started this war that has been going on for 100 years ? No one seems to remember but the important thing is to destroy the other guy. And that's the premise for the entire series of 6 books, recently expanded to 7 although on a different story arc with the same characters in this series.Having been in an escape pod frozen for 100 years Jack Geary has the most seniority of anyone on board the Earth Flagship Dauntless. So when the Fleet Admiral and all his senior officers go over to the Syndic flagship to sign off a peace treaty and are killed, Jack Geary becomes the ranking officer and his first task is to get the remaining Earth fleet out of Syndic space and back home.It isn't going to be easy because the current military strategy is to rush in and see how many enemy ships you can destroy.  A good recipe for dramatic fights but as Admiral Jack Geary knows not really a viable method to win a war.Movement between star systems is via Syndic hypernet gates and jump points and it's up to Admiral Geary to get the fleet home. But not directly to Earth as he doesn't want to bring the Syndic fleet back to Earth (they don't really know where it is).Also the Dauntless has one of the Syndic hypernet keys that must be returned to Earth. The Syndics are not aware  that they have the key.Combining military strategy from a 100 years ago Admiral Geary manages to get the fleet closer to Earth in this volume of the adventure.This a great military science fiction series with well developed characters and space battle strategies",

I started before breakfast, kept reading through breakfast, took a short break then read through lunch until I finished it around 4:30 pm. It's been many a long year since I've done that so, rather than discuss plot lines, writing style etc, I will simply say that this book is well-worth reading by anyone who is a fan of this genre. I just hope that the rest of this series can live up to the standard of this first book.",

Battles are well constructed with no need for a science degree or military training to understand , weapons are kept basic and putting it simply the book delivers.

Lo sto ancora leggendo quindi è WIPLa storia molto semplice e lineare - due fazioni in lotta, una flotta inseguitrice e una in fuga, un comandante di altri tempi (in questo caso è proprio il caso di dirlo) - nemici interni ed esterni - ma è raccontata in maniera coinvolgente. I personaggi sono decentemente rappresentati (pur senza particolare analisi) ma la parte più interessante è senza dubbio quella militare. Le battaglie sono molto epiche e l'autore ha speso abbastanza per creare un universo fisico di regole e leggi realistiche per imbrigliare lo svolgimento (molto bella l'idea di dover a che fare con il ritardo delle comunicazioni nello spazio per il coordinamento delle varie navi).Se vipiace il genere e sapete l'inglese lo consiglio molto",

    "bookDescription": "A thrilling new novel based on the Paramount+ TV series Star Trek: Strange New Worlds!While patrolling the borders of the Klingon Empire, Captain Christopher Pike and the crew of the USS Enterprise record a series of subspace echoes from a planet orbiting a volatile flare star—and when Lieutenant Spock and Commander Una Chin-Riley lead a landing party to learn more, they discover the ruins of a dead civilization and evidence of starship-grade metals…quite possibly a crash site. As they continue to investigate the strange signals, Spock and Una find shocking signs of dangerous alien life and remnants of what can only be Federation hardware. The trail soon leads Pike andEnterprise’s helmswoman Lieutenant Erica Ortegas deep into the mystery of a lost Starfleet vessel, missing in action for over ninety years—and to a terrible dilemma that will challenge the crew to question their past...and their future.",

The book is pretty good though not as good as Asylum or The High Country.  I would probably give it a higher rating but I just don’t understand what seems to be an error to me.  Why is the Denobulan Ensign Yerah referred to by the pronouns they and their?  As far as I know Denobulans are either male or female, i. e. Doctor Phlox and his family on Star Trek Enterprise.  It seems like this was just thrown in to make some kind of political statement and was very confusing.  Thus the 3 stars.",

An engaging and well-paced story, yes, organically rooted in treks past, but above all else, the author perfectly captures Anson Mount's take on Pike, Rebecca Romijn's Number One, Ethan Peck's Spock, indeed each and every one one of the principal characters/cast. Moreso than any Trek novel, of any generation, that I've ever read, this one lets you HEAR the known characters in every line of dialogue. Swallow gives fans something worth chewing on.",

        "reviewDescription": "I’m a UK Original Series TV Show watcher, who loved the novelisations from a time before VHS was commercially available. The technical manuals & production book were also great, but whilst the novels were all disappointing, I am a completist. Also, by the time of Rick Berman’s final days the show was ready for Cremation.Sadly, the mutation to a franchise, the search for a new audience & dystopian world that we are moving to have generated these novels.It’s noticeable that some series no longer publish novels & I suspect that we are reaching the last days of this type of “Merchandise”.So if you have a different view this is for you.",

    "bookDescription": "“There is nobody who does [military SF] better than Marko Kloos. His Frontlines series is a worthy successor to such classics as Starship Troopers, The Forever War, and We All Died at Breakaway Station.” —George R. R. Martin\nThe year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements: You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world . . . or you can join the service.\nWith the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price . . . and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.\nThe debut novel from Marko Kloos, Terms of Enlistment is an addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi.\nRevised edition: This edition of  Terms of Enlistment  includes editorial revisions.",

        "reviewDescription": "I do not give out 5-star ratings to anything casually. The best you are going to get out of me if I like something is 4-stars. I reserve 5-star reviews for things which have something special about them. They don't have to knock my socks off, but they have to have something to offer that is more than just \"good.\"  However, that being said, Terms Of Enlistment knocked my socks off!It's just ... it's just so good!  I am a huge fan of the military science fiction genre. I love books like The Lost Fleet Series by Jack Campbell, and The Man of War Series by H. Paul Honsinger. Kloos, Honsinger and Campbell all understand how to mix together elements of honor, excitement, duty, realistic military descriptions, and space-faring ships crewed by humans in a way that is just spell binding. These kinds of books are capable of keeping me up until 4 AM to read \"just one more chapter\" because I HAVE TO find out what happens next!Kloos, like Campbell and Honsinger, writes exciting military science fiction that depicts humanity realistically, but with some artistic license to keep things interesting. None of them go too dark with their stories (no rape, no torture, no crimes against women), and all of them tell interesting, page-turner tales.In Terms of Enlistment, Kloos tells the story of a dystopian future for humanity (rapidly approaching in real-life, at the rate things are going) where the Earth is over-populated, and humanity has reached the stars. Things are pretty desperate on earth if you aren't born to a family with money. Most of humanity is living in welfare cities called Public Residential Centers (PRCs) that double as ghettos to keep the poor in one place. The powers on Earth have split into two main factions, the North American Commonwealth (NAC), which is basically all of the Western Hemisphere vs. the Sino-Russian Alliance (SRA), which is basically all of the Eastern Hemisphere.The main character in the book, Andrew Grayson, was born in a PRC, in what used to be called Boston, before it merged with all of the rest of the mega-cities in the area. He is joining the military to get out of the poverty he was born into, as the military is pretty much the only meritocracy left on Earth that everyone has a chance to make it with.What follows is a fast-paced, extremely interesting story that is very accurate on the military details, and contains a surprising amount of human-interest elements as well. Grayson starts out as ground-soldier, and by the end of the story he is living through adventures that are amazing, and set the stage for the sequel.  You are with Grayson every step of they way, and you understand him, and the choices he makes. The loyalty shown amongst the soldiers rings very true, and is very appreciated in the story (those kinds of elements are why I read military sci-fi in the first place).Star Wars and Star Trek fans will feel mostly at home in this universe, although the tone of the series is much more Starship Troopers, but with less graphic violence. Read it, you will be glad you did.5 stars!---------------------------------Book Content Guide For Parents:---------------------------------Sex & Nudity: [3/5] the military of the future is an integrated military, so the males and females sleep and shower together. Characters are depicted having sex together, but not in graphic detail (descriptions amount to phrases such as \"enjoy each other's bodies\", that sort of stuff). Any child over 12 will know what is going on, but it isn't any more graphic than prime-time TV dramas (I would actually said it is quite tamer).Violence & Gore: [3/5] numerous military battles take place, and humans are killed. No torture, and no gore or graphic details. But descriptions of things like grenades blowing holes in peoples chests, and descriptions of people being shot, and what it feels like to have their lung collapse do occur. I would say the violence levels are at the PG to PG-13 level.Profanity: [4/5] it is a military novel, OF COURSE it has language in it. All of the \"big 4\" make it into the language of the soldiers, but not actually as often as you might expect. Nothing too terribly graphic or offensive, though (no bodily descriptions, crude sexual remarks, racial epithets, or hate-speech).Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking: [2/5] I don't recall any smoking, drug abuse is commented on in the PRCs but never depicted, but there is a bit of drinking in the story, nothing graphic or glamorized, though.Frightening/Intense Scenes: [3/5] standard PG/PG-13 action/war movie stuff. There are some intense military battles, soldiers die, and the protagonist is in mortal danger more than once. But it is never horrifying or sadistic stuff. Quite tame compared to some of the horror shows I have had to endure lately. None of it bothered me.",

        "reviewDescription": "I just finished this book and very much enjoyed it. I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of military sci-fi or military stories in general, and think it hits all the fun notes. My 4 star review (rather than 5) is based on a structural weakness in the narrative that I personally didn't like, but that should not discourage you from picking this up.In my opinion, while the last third of the book tells the complete story of the first skirmish in a brand new war, it mainly sets up the rest of the series, rather than concluding the narrative of the book itself. The last third of the book reads like the first few episodes of a TV show, foreshadowing the rest of the season and a lot of stuff to come, rather than raising a problem and bringing it to a satisfying conclusion. It's fun, but left me wanting more, and makes reading the second book feel like a requirement to continue the story I just started to read, rather than a sequel that builds upon a complete story.The reason I mention the last third specifically is that this actually feels like two separate books. My biggest critique is a huge pivot - the first two-thirds of the book deal with the POV character's journey into the future Army, and sets up some pretty big events when they got dropped into a \"Black Hawk Down\" type of situation. However, after a thrilling ground battle, the book casually hand waves away the aftermath of those events (which seemed like a huge deal!) and pivots almost immediately to a space/navy story with a bit of an Aliens and Cloverfield vibe. It really feels like two independent stories jammed together (this Army story just morphed into a Navy story!) and I found this shift a bit jarring. Both stories were fun, but the last 1/3 of the book honestly made the first 2/3s (the Army portion) feel rather superfluous. Nothing much carried over into the last third, and really, the only bits kept in the last 3rd were some character development - everything else was pretty much tossed. I'm not sure if this is a result of a long development time (and lots of tweaking) or an intentional choice by the author, but I'm calling it out since it did seem odd, and while I enjoyed the first 2/3s, the last third made me wonder why I'd read them. They didn't seem to have much bearing on the final plot.To be clear, though, this is a fun book. When you set aside my structural critiques, I actually really enjoyed the story itself, and it did the best thing I could expect - it kept me reading (I finished the book in three days). The prose is well-written and feels in the same vibe as Starship Troopers (the book, not the movie) and other military sci-fi exploring military service and war from the perspective of grunts on the ground (or, in the last 3rd, in space). The military tech was cool, the battles were great, and the eventual reveal of the true threat felt different enough from similar books in this genre. I liked the fact that the eventual antagonists encountered felt different.So, I'd absolutely recommend Terms of Enlistment if you enjoy military sci-fi or military stories in general. Though my structural critiques kept it from hitting five stars, it hits all the fun notes, and I'm picking up the next book (the next part of the season!) today.",

The turn point came around the third chapter or later, and I realised that I started enjoying the read and soon I was really into it. It seems Marko (and the reader) needs some time to warm into the story but then it just carries you with it.You get a dark and believable future in the book, decent characters and a good amount of military geekiness, which all together make a realistic and believable story.

        "reviewDescription": "I'm a casual reader and usually read a few pages in bed to fall asleep. Usually it takes weeks or even months to finish a book. This one was done within a week. The story kept pulling me back in the book and before I knew it, I was already half way in 3 days. Spoiler alert: Some scenes felt a bit repeatable like the thermobaric round on the sniper and a few pages ahead another thermobaric round into the apartment building. Also, why didn't the dropship destroy the heavy guns on the rooftops and whatever happened to the sniper in the city? Also fitting a tight flight helmet when you have a big cut on your face would be worth mentioning a few times. Other than that, great read, exactly my taste.",

Now he is an exile, living out a feeble existence on the miserable world of Sedh, leading a dwindling cabal of warriors against the interminable appetites of rampaging orks. Determined to reclaim his birthright, Oltyx returns to the heart of the court that cast him out, and so begins a journey of profound discovery, the secrets of which are entangled with the origins of the necrons themselves. And if Oltyx is to save his precious Ithakas Dynasty from the barbaric war-cult known as the Imperium of Man, he must become the kind of king he never expected to be.

    "bookDescription": "\"Move over, Kirk and Spock—Quintos and Pristy are my new favorite space heroes!\"\n—Melissa Patterson, ARC reader\nCaptain Galvin Quintos commands humanity's most advanced battle group in a desperate mission to the galaxy's edge, where the Techno-Mycoids have returned with unprecedented force. This fungal-mechanical species, previously encountered in smaller numbers, now fields massive fleets systematically consuming the peaceful Zephyrian civilization. With thirty-six billion souls already assimilated into their grotesque bio-mechanical war machine, time is running out for both the Zephyrians and potentially all organic life in the galaxy.Armed with cutting-edge omninought-class warships and thousands of DreadBots equipped with experimental sesquiterpene weapons, the fleet faces impossible mathematical odds. The enemy's hive-mind intelligence seems to anticipate every tactical move, suggesting they possess foreknowledge that shouldn't be possible.Captain Gail Pristy commands the battle group's oldest and most vulnerable vessel while navigating her complicated romantic history with Quintos. Their personal relationship becomes secondary to survival when a catastrophic malfunction in the ship's recreational systems unleashes a deadly pathogen that transforms artificial beings into ravenous killing machines.Sonya Winters, Quintos's brilliant eighteen-year-old niece and MIT student, finds herself at the center of the crisis. Her deep understanding of the ship's biological systems—and her complicated friendship with the Pleidian officer responsible for the outbreak—forces her to make devastating choices that could either doom or save humanity.As infected creatures spread chaos throughout the fleet, temporal anomalies caused by the enigmatic time-traveler General Resnick create critical blind spots in the enemy's perfect coordination. In a final confrontation spanning multiple realities, an accidental biological weapon becomes humanity's unexpected salvation against seemingly invincible foes, proving that sometimes victory emerges from the most catastrophic failures.Reviews:-USS Battlestrike is military science fiction at its finest.

        "reviewDescription": "In a galaxy where there is no black and white - really only the blackness of one or many egos in constant battle this book pulls no punches and lays it all bare. The “why” of it all reads like death filled poetry of betrayal after betrayal.The action is great. In a series like this where bolters and lasguns and chain sword fights are common, each assault, battle, and duel still feels fresh and exciting. There are enough twists and turns to both fulfill the foreshadowing but not make what happens next obvious. At this point of my reading there are 40+ books and I will keep reading until it becomes stale. I hope it never gets stale!",

        "reviewTitle": "Well Developed Action Tale",
        "reviewDescription": "This work is the third book in the growing series telling the tale of the Horus Heresy, a pivotal historical event in Games Workshop's Warhammer 40K fictional universe. Most of the characters from the first two novels carry through to this one: Garviel Lorken and Tarik Torgaddon of the Sons of Horus, Saul Tarvitz of the Emperor's Children, Nathanial Garro of the Death Guard, and Kyril Sindermann the remembrancer. In addition, we get appearances by a number of primarchs and other dramatis personae recognizable from the tabletop game.I have been critical of Ben Counter's work in the past, which has been short on plot even though he typically writes good action scenes. However, in this work he surpasses his earlier efforts, providing excellent character interaction worthy of Abnett along with solid action sequences throughout. Instead of writing bad, difficult to believe \"seduction by the Warp\" scenes, which tripped up Graham McNeill in the second book, he presents much of it after the fact as loyalist characters question how it all could have gone so wrong so fast - and does it well.The plot focuses on the few individuals who resist the growing tide of corruption with the Crusade, and does a credible job continuing the outstanding development started by Dan Abnett in Horus Rising. Counter follows them through the battles and conflicts that he writes so well, but still does a surprisingly solid job at depicting the creep of injustice and tyranny through Horus' forces.The weakest portion of the book is the ending, which ham-handedly forces things into position for the next author in the series (Flight of the Eisenstein by James Swallow), as well as inducing a cliffhanger of sorts.In short: generally well written and entertaining throughout, it's well worth a read for any fan of 40K novels. As an added bonus, it took away the bad taste left in my mouth after finishing False Gods.",

    "bookDescription": "During a test flight for the world’s first warp engine, Major Noah Gantz is set to go down in the history books.\nDespite years of training, the mission goes sideways, and instead of a quick trip to the moon and back, Noah's ship is transported across the universe to stars unknown.\nStranded in space and on the brink of death, Noah is rescued by a sentient starship and its captain. To save his life, the ship’s own biomatter must replace his failing cells.\nNow , Noah is different. Stronger, faster… and there’s a voice in his head.\nThe voice of the ship itself, and its name is Kayan.\nWith no way to return home, Noah must adapt and rebuild his life in this unfamiliar corner of the universe. And as he does, he discovers a looming threat in the far reaches of space, growing in power, and set on capturing Noah and his ship.\nWorse still, this new enemy knows about Earth. . . and it has big plans.",

        "reviewDescription": "This is an interesting sci-fi novel, book 1 of a series. It reminds me a lot of a certain TV show, with the characters tweaked enough to avoid copyright, but the plot is different enough that I did read the whole book and purchase Book 2 as well. The POV character, supposedly a top Earth astronaut, comes across as rather immature a lot of the time when I would like to see more quiet confidence and self-esteem, but he's basically a good guy, especially as opposed to the villains we meet. If you're looking for a nice, light read, try this one out.",

        "reviewDescription": "I'm guessing the author had some inspiration from the TV show \"Farscape\" as it follows a similar Astronaut-lost-in-space theme. That's not to say \"Homeworld Lost\" isn't original, because it is, with plenty of interesting twists and turns along the way. I'm particularly fascinated by Kayan. She(?) is a living ship, like Moya from the aforementioned \"Farscape,\" but the author has developed the concept into a unique element of the narrative, with virtually unlimited potential to continue developing as both a character in the story as well as a plot device. I look forward to learning more about her in future books.While I have enjoyed other books by this author, I'm a bit excited by this one, because this novel has the potential to become a massive franchise. While the major plot points could be wrapped up in just one more novel if the author chooses to cut it short, alternatively, it has the chops to be developed into an expanded-universe with numerous books to expand the overall tale. I look forward to reading the next one, and hope more are to come.",

        "reviewTitle": "Good, But Doesn't Match Other Series",
        "reviewDescription": "In comparison to the works of a number of authors out there, this would be a four-star book.  However, Mr. Chaney and his various collaborators have so many good series out there (Renegade Stars, Last Hunter, and perhaps one of his best - Backyard Starship and the Peacemaker series) that it's hard not to judge this series in light of those that preceded it.So many of his other series grabbed me early in the book.  I quickly became invested in the main character and knew well before I finished the book that I would be buying the next one in the series.  Not so much with this book.  The overall plot was interesting, but I spend quite a bit of the book wondering if I wanted to continue the series.  I didn't quickly become immersed in this book like I have in the first book of the author's other series, and I certainly didn't become immersed in the main character.Here's a man who's supposed to be one of the very best, considering the mission he was chosen for - smart, talented, and one would assume, trustworthy and a number of other characteristics.  He didn't sell those attributes very well.  He came across as a smart-alecky 15-year-old kid.  He can't even figure out that his many earth-based phrases and colloquialisms don't register with aliens and he's wasting everyone's time by continuing to use (and over-use) them.  You just feel like you want to shake him and tell him to grow up!However, there were enough interesting moments that I have purchased the 2nd book in the series.  I will see how much the character grows.One comment:  I look at the star rating like school grades - 5=A, 4=B, 3=C, 2=D, 1=F.  My rating of 3 starts says I think it's an average book.  I have troubles with people who will rate a book 3 stars but talk about how much they didn't like it and won't continue the series.  That's a 1-star review, or perhaps 2.I like these authors, and the book got a lot of 5-star reviews, so if it looks interesting, give it a try.  You may like it better than I did (and I did buy the next book, so I think the series has some hope).",

        "reviewDescription": "Caleb Card and Sheriff Hayden Duke are my favorite science fiction characters. I was so happy that MR Forbes brought Caleb back to team up with Sheriff Duke in what has been an incredible adventure. As I have come to expect in the Forbes universe, threads from other series weave their way into a plot that is fast-paced, imaginative, and full of unexpected twists and turns. Caleb and Hayden must face an opponent more cruel, conniving, and terrifying than any they have met before. I highly recommend not only this series but all of the Forbes novels that preceded it. Welcome back, Caleb! I have missed you!",

It's tricky to weave tales in multiverses like this, but when done well, it rewards the readers of the other works greatly.It reminds me of my Enjoyment of the Dark Tower cycle by King. I was a fan of his other books that he used characters from in that lovely time/multiverse traveling science fi fantasy western series... I was delighted to know that some of his favorites of his own work were mine as well.This series is in that rare genre bending category. I like it. Hope it ends well... sometimes the best endings aren't what the audience expects, but what the story itself demands. I'm curious as to what is next.d",

        "reviewDescription": "This is a a compelling tale that builds on the first. The battles (at least physical) are the least meaningful part of the tale - in the best way. This novel digs deep into the character of each character in a way that is more than just blind good/evil but one of degree. It’s these gray areas that move the story along and made me, the reader think about my own beliefs of humanity and it’s nature.A well crafted tale that after writing the review moves my rating higher.",

        "reviewDescription": "The second book of the Horus Heresy series, this time penned by Graham McNeill, is a ripping adventure tale that continues the story of Horus' inevitable fall. Garviel Lorken, the Company Captain of the Sons of Horus Legion and main protagonist from the first novel, now shares the stage with Horus himself in roughly equal measure. The supporting cast is too numerous to list here, but suffice to say, it includes many other canonical characters from Games Workshop's Warhammer 40K universe: Horus, Angron, Fulgrim, Magnus, Kharn, Abaddon, Fabius, and others.M. McNeill does an excellent job capturing the feel of the 40K background, excels at action scenes, and captures the epic scope of the Crusade and subsequent Heresy. You really feel the ground tremor as titans stride into battle, and quail before Angron's savagery as he charges into the fray. The enemies of the Imperium fight intelligent campaigns that reflect well thought out strategy, making them worthy foes.Gone, however, is the subtlety and delicate moral quandary of M. Abnett. Lorken's character growth, and that of some of the other characters, takes a back seat to Horus' tale and larger-scale conflict. This brings me to the two weaker points of the novel:1 - M. McNeill uses some clumsy plot devices at key points in the work. The Mournival (Horus' council of Captains) and some of the senior Sons of Horus act stupidly or ignorantly from time to time, even though it's been firmly established that they are neither. There are a few other instances where Marines \"regress\" from extremely wily to easily misled.2 - The biggest difficulty, however, is in the representation of the change in Horus. There are no slippery moral slopes filled with the excuses of expediency or necessity. There is no gradual or subtle descent, such as those displayed by M. Abnett's Inquisitor Eisenhorn. Instead, Horus takes the Warp induced visions of a man he admittedly doesn't even trust, and makes a decision without even checking the veracity of these mirages. As it's really one of the pivotal moments of the entire epic, it's disappointing that it doesn't receive the attention it deserves.These - although fairly significant - detractors aside, the book is a very engaging read, and M. McNeill's writing style holds the reader's attention throughout. The plot flows well, and one can't wait to begin the next chapter after finishing the previous.In short: a generally solid work with a few troubles for more discerning readers. However, any fan of 40K will easily get his money's worth on this ride.",

        "reviewDescription": "Like watching film of 9-11, or the attack on Pearl Harbor, or the start of World War I.  A haunting sense of imminent tragedy that we can see coming but cannot  avert.To be honest, before I read this book and Horus Rising I was not really looking forward to reading the Horus Heresy novels.  I thought I already knew the story, the characters would be flat caricatures, and much of the action would be like something out of a well-funded but completely derivative comic-book movie.  I have come to expect great things from Dan Abnett and Graham McNeill, but I feared that even writers with their talent would be hard-pressed to make such a formula work.I am very happy to report that I could not have been more wrong.  The plot is epic, in a quite literal sense; the rich and mysterious tapestry forming the backdrop for the action - the descriptions of the physical environments and the social, historical, and even mythological contexts in which the plot unfolds — is mesmerizing, horrifying, and heartbreaking all at once; and the central characters - Loken, Torgaddon, Karkasy [sp?], and Keeler in particular - are well-drawn and tremendously sympathetic.  If you enjoyed the Eisenhorn, Ravenor, and Gaunt’s Ghosts series, you will love this book.",

        "reviewDescription": "I'm currently reading the sixth book of this series, Renegade Dawn...and I've enjoyed each and every one of them so far. Though it reminds me of other sci-fi (mostly from tv and film), that's part of what makes the story enjoyable. It has a familiar feel to it, yet Chaney has found a way to tell a story like others you may have read or seen, in a way that still feels pretty fresh and fun. The main character, Jace Hughes, feels a lot like others I've met before...a certain former Browncoat on the run from the Alliance, a smuggling Scoundrel joining a fight against the Empire, and as I saw noted in another review, even a certain archaeologist that has a fondness for a particular fedora. I'd say this similarity helps you feel like you already know the character a bit when first introduced to him, and as you get to know him through the story, you like him a bit more every page.There are so many different science fiction stories out there, that I'm sure it's difficult to create a story that feels truly unique and original...Chaney has written a series of stories that, while they do feel familiar, have enough character and depth to draw you in and hold you, and a story that did feel different to me...very enjoyable.Also, I'd like to throw in a thanks to the author - so many sci-fi writers easily bog down a story by focusing on the technical, or by trying to be overly original and unique and come up with all new names for things...Chaney keeps things a bit more simple, and explains what is necessary along the way...that helps the reader jump right into the story, and not feel overwhelmed or confused. I really liked and appreciated that.",

        "reviewDescription": "Hey there book lovers! It is your old pal, Ninetoes, coming at you with a review of J. N. Chaney's Renegade Star. I have coffee in my system, and my thinking cap on, so let's do this!This book has been on my to-be-read list for a long time now. Last night, I decided to try it, and I am glad I did.Jace Hughes is a Renegade pilot, basically a mercenary/pirate who tries to be hard-hearted, but has that \"hooker with a heart of gold\" vibe. He owes a lot of money to a ganglord, and jobs are few and far between. He takes a job transporting nun and her cargo from point A to point B. Easy peasy, right? Well if it was, this would be a very short read. His problems start when he inquires about the cargo, and when he finds out what the cargo is, his entire universe is upended and he finds himself on the run from a galactic government as well as the earlier mentioned crimelord. Those who oppose him have not taken into account that he will do anything to protect his ship, and its passengers and cargo. ANYTHING.This book moves fast. The kind of read it in one sitting fast. The three hundred pages fly by and before you know it, you are done, and that is a good thing. The writing is sharp, the pace fluid, and the characters enjoyable. I actually cared about what went on with the characters and that drove the story forward.The problem I had is it reminded me too much of a certain series set in a galaxy far far away, as well as a merry band of misfits led by a space cowboy. To me, the book leans heavily on that, but it was not enough to stop me from reading it, and it did not kill the overall enjoyment. Will I continue to read the series? Yes. I plan to read the rest of the (checks notes) fifteen* books in the series. Fifteen? Oh, okay, sure, I plan on reading the rest of the fifteen books in the series!I give this one 4 bookmarks out of 5!* This series is also in a bundle of all sixteen books for $9.99. If you get them on their own they are $4.99 each. I plan on getting the bundle, and I encourage you to do the same.Happy Reading!",

The protagonist Jace Hughes is a renegade who is taking on all forms of illegal business while dodging the watchful eye of the Union who is now governing most of known space. In an effort to pay off a debt he meets a strange nun and with an even stranger cargo. The story that unfolds is well written and mysterious as Jace proceeds to get in over his head in this new space opera. The action sequences are exciting and fluid while the dialogue is believable and moves at a refreshing pace.I am really excited to see this gem pop up. I am looking forward to reading more of this series and it appears we won't have to wait long as the next installment will be coming out soon. Another great book from a great author!",

    "bookDescription": "Lord Commander Eidolon is haunted. Aboard his ship, daemonic manifestations abound and threaten to tear it apart. Yet, even as he vanquishes it, he feels the pull to a world he once knew, and a reunion with a part of him thought lost.Lord Commander Primus Eidolon has claimed many titles along the annals of his infamy. He is the Exemplar and the Risen; the Soul-Severed; the Auric Hammer. Now, fallen far from his primarch’s grace, he carves a path to Terra, where the culmination of Horus’ grand Heresy awaits.  But coaxed and goaded by the wiles of the warp – and an entity whose whispered truths stretch even his credulity – he finds himself stranded around the world of Tatricala, where the ghosts of his past haunt every fated step. And now he must make a choice which life he wants to lead… and how much of his soul he is willing to sacrifice for it.  For if Eidolon cannot banish his daemons, then they will surely take him for their own.",

        "reviewDescription": "\"Eidolon: The Auric Hammer\" absolutely blew me away. If you’re a fan of the Horus Heresy or the Emperor’s Children specifically, this is one of those stories that grabs you from the first page and doesn’t let go. The writing nails that perfect mix of elegance and brutality that defines the III Legion, and Eidolon himself is portrayed exactly how I hoped—arrogant, ruthless, and endlessly fascinating.The action is sharp, visceral, and incredibly cinematic. Every battle scene feels intense without ever getting confusing, and the character moments in between give the story real weight. I also loved how this book adds depth to the Legion’s slide into corruption. It doesn’t just tell you what happened—it shows you, through grim decisions, twisted pride, and those unsettling glimpses of what’s to come.For anyone collecting the Primarch or Heresy novellas, this is a standout. It’s a quick read but a powerful one, and it fits beautifully into the larger lore. Easily one of the best Emperor’s Children stories I’ve read in a long time.Highly recommend for any Warhammer or sci-fi fan looking for something dark, stylish, and full of character.",

It's a novelization of a Warhammer WWE event that could have been summarized in ten pages. Even the best 40k authors can be excessive with the filler in places. Usually they hit a few interesting plot points. Unfortunately, this book was all filler.  It took me two months to finish this short book. There were no interesting plot threads to follow and I am cursed with the need to finish every 40K novel I start.",

The paper used in the book is good quality and the printing pristine with a very readable size of font.This edition is not a paperback but a sturdy hardback with foiled cover writingI do not read these myself but I know from experience of our young person that this  would make a fabulous addition to any Warhammer fan’s book shelf",

    "bookDescription": "We were fighting on the wrong side, of a war we couldn't win. And that was the good news. The Ruhar hit us on Columbus Day. There we were, innocently drifting along the cosmos on our little blue marble, like the native Americans in 1492. Over the horizon come ships of a technologically advanced, aggressive culture, and BAM! There go the good old days, when humans only got killed by each other. So, Columbus Day. It fits. When the morning sky twinkled again, this time with Kristang starships jumping in to hammer the Ruhar, we thought we were saved. The UN Expeditionary Force hitched a ride on Kristang ships to fight the Ruhar, wherever our new allies thought we could be useful. So, I went from fighting with the US Army in Nigeria, to fighting in space. It was lies, all of it. We shouldn't even be fighting the Ruhar, they aren't our enemy, our allies are. I'd better start at the beginning....A selection of scenes from Columbus Day:There was a faint click, and the other door popped open a quarter inch. Cautiously, I pulled it open and stuck my head in. Beyond the door was a warehouse, maybe fifty feet by thirty, twenty feet tall, filled with racks of what I thought was mostly old, useless, dirty, dusty broken junk. I wandered in cautiously. Why the Ruhar had made the effort to store any of it made no sense to me. Surely there had to be something in there that I could use as a weapon.A man’s voice, with a snarky attitude, rang out behind me. “Excellent! Bipedal, 1300cc brain, opposable thumbs. A hairless monkey. You can carry me out of here.”I spun around in a panic. No one was there. “Who said that?”“Me. Here, I’m the shiny cylinder on the shelf. I unlocked that door.\"“You are? You mean you’re talking to me through a speaker in that thing?”“No, I am that thing. I am what you monkeys call an artificial intelligence.”I cocked my head and examined it skeptically. “You look like a chrome-plated beer can.\" That was a completely accurate description. The cylinder even tapered slightly at the top, and was ringed by a ridge. \"You’re really an AI?\"\"Yup. You should refer to me as The Lord God Almighty.”“That position is already filled. I think I’ll call you Skippy.”“Don’t call me that, it sounds disrespectful, monkey.”“You prefer shithead? Because that’s the other option, Skippy-O.” I kept glancing around, fearing the Ruhar would hear me.“Can we compromise on The Great and Powerful Oz?” It asked.“I’m not a flying monkey, so that’s a no, Skippy.”“Unacceptable.”“How about we go for something more formal, like Skippy McSkippster?”“No.”“Skippy Skipperson? Skippy Skippkowski? Skippy Von Skipping? Or maybe Sir Skippy Skippton-Skippersworth?”“No, no, no and NO!”“I can go on like this all day.”“I believe you could.”\"What you got?\" Ski asked.Cornpone winked. \"Uh, let's see. Damn! I got a gen-u-ine smorgasbord of Hooah! bars.\"\"A smorgasbord?\" I asked skeptically. \"Really?\"\"Oh yeah, a smorgasbord at least. Could be a plethora, maybe even, oooh, an honest to God, gosh-darned corn-u-copia of snack foods.\" It was funny to hear Jesse say 'plethora' in his deep southern accent.\"Cut the bullshit, man, you're making me hungry.\" Ski protested. \"What flavors you got in there?\"\"Well, I got Cinnamon Cardboard, of course, also Raisins 'n' Gravel, and, my personal fave, Original Sawdust.\"Crap. I got stuck with Raisin 'n' Gravel. The raisins were harder to chew than the gravel.“Space combat sounds complicated.” I thought back to when I’d listened to the Chicken pilot talk about air combat after our first war game, on Camp Alpha.“Uh huh. Then there’s the Skippy factor.”Part of me wanted to avoid taking the bait. “The Skippy factor?”“You know, my incredible awesomeness.”",

        "reviewDescription": "Great book even for a non-scifi fan such as myself. Generally speaking if I have to choose between magic or science in my books I always go for magic.  So what made me pick this one up you might ask?  That's simple.  I wax a road trip with my scifi loving husband and listening to bits a piece of this series on Audible.  That's how I fell in love with the character Skippy.  I think he really adds the much needed comic relief this book needed to bring home all the elements of a truly entertaining story.When my husband told me about this book series he said I'd love it because Skippy is just like Bob from The Dresden Files but an AI instead of spirit.  And that got my attention piqued, cuz, in my opinion, The Dresden Files is the absolute best urban fantasy series out there.  And Bob is definitely a favorite among many, many great unique characters.  And Expeditionary Force: Columbus Day did not disappoint.When I picked it up, I originally I would be just reading it for Skippy, because that bits I'd heard with Skippy while on road trips liking to the audio book were hilarious.  But, much to my surprise, I found myself enjoying the book right from the beginning. And that is factoring that Skipoy doesn't even show up until around the middle  of the book.  It doesn't bog you with to much nerdy scifi tech talk.  The story is a great easy read right from the start with Joe being a really relatable, easy to like character.  And right about when the book could srguable have died from the story stagnating from repeating themes the author expertly and suddenly takes the story on a dramatic 90° turn with the entrance of Skippy.At this point, Skippy could have easily taken over the story if it weren't for Joe's ability to ground Skippy's ego more the realms of us hairless monkey's idea of reality.  The two play off of each other so well it's almost like  a expertly choreographed dance.Bottom line, it's a very entertaining book to read and I highly reccomend it.  And if you're more of a magic or Dersden Files  fan then I think you will enjoy this book too.",

        "reviewDescription": "This is a simply outstanding series.  I am very glad that I discovered it AFTER he wrote four books so that I wouldn't go into serious withdrawal issues upon completing Columbus Day.  It's original, clever, funny, and a real delight.You have an ordinary Joe who just wants to serve his country and go home, but he finds himself in the middle of an interplanetary invasion by...hamsters.  Yes, the aliens are similar to bipedal hamsters.  Alanson had me right there.  Hamsters?He gets a scratch team together and manages to capture two aliens.  He treats them well and turns them over to the authorities, figures that's the end of it.  The war goes on, and another alien army shows up.  They conquer the hamsters and seem to enlist Earth as an ally.  They're lizards, and you know you just can't trust lizards.Earth sends military forces out with the lizard ships, ostensibly to be trained and used in the war against the hamsters, but they end up on the hamster planet as occupation forces.  Joe is semi-famous for capturing hamsters on Earth, but here he's considered trouble, and the plan is to station him at a remote area where he can't make more trouble.He befriends a hamster official who turns out to be in charge of the hamster government, and learns a lot more about their supposed allies, the lizards.  They aren't allies...just slave labor in training for the lizard overlords.  Yet another alien nation is participating in this messy war, but they're mainly support and transport.  They don't get into the messy stuff, just deliver lizard ships and supplies.You can't tell the players without a score card in this interstellar war zone, and Joe realizes humanity has been duped into helping the equivalent of space Nazis in their regime.  He tries to get the information to the decision-makers, only to discover that he's in more trouble...and then in jail, awaiting execution.  He's locked in a makeshift cell with some stuff stored in it, and there he finds an ancient alien Artificial Intelligence unit who is millions of years old, knows everything, and is bored out of his little metal gourd.  He actually occupies a huge volume of space in another dimension, but in this one, he's manifested as something like a silver beer can with an attitude.With the help of Skippy, the AI, Joe and a few other prisoners escape and try to save themselves...and planet Earth, a wormhole away from their present location.I love this series, and in fact, went ahead and bought all four of the main books so that I could find out how this all went.  There are some minor editing issues (you and  your, omitted words, phrases that were \"test-driven\" and not used, which should have been removed.  The story is good enough that I'll put up with that stuff just to find out what happens to our merry band of space pirates next.  After all, that's what they are.  Pirates operating under the guidance of an ancient intelligence who can manipulate computer systems, wormholes, and so much more, particularly with the help of the \"monkeys,\" his term for humans.",

It feels more believable than some military stories, where it's obvious that someone knows the words, but never lived the life. This one, I could believe the author was familiar with the military lifestyle rather than just aware of it.Skippy is annoying, abrasive, yet still very likable. Sometimes he seems a little too much Skippy, but there is some growth that happens and it's good to see that. I'm also glad he's not right all the time.Well, the book is mostly well written. I did find a couple few errors here and there, mostly grammatical. All in all a very good book. Would recommend, will check out the next one.",

Sit back and enjoy the adventures.In my opinion the book is well written; the author does a great job with pacing and story telling. You'll find yourself wanting to find out more about the next chapter as the story develops.The characters all have different personalities and you'll quickly become invested in their individual stories and fight for survival.If you're not a big reader, give the audiobook a try. Its an excellent listen.I'll definitely be buying the full collection",

        "reviewDescription": "I'll only comment the first book of the series, but this is valid for the whole series (eight books, some spin offs and at least one more in the oven): It's plainly addictive basic adventures-in-space scifi, full of action, cliffhangers (pretty well resolved ones, by the way) and well-placed flashes of humour.It's true that you should not expect here any hard science facts , but the universe depicted has that coherence of functioning that you don't find so easily. The tapestry of alien races, each one with their own motives and each one with some individual characters is extremely well done. Mr. Alanson has the knack of describing characters that *are interesting*, that is: after some pages you really care for what is going to happen to a lot of them.And the action of the plot is a freight train on the loose. It's true as well that some lines of the plot are repetitive, with the same characters making similar things, but it is son neatly done that you not only don't care, but you do expect it to be resolved thus.I am really expecting book number 9 and I thank Mr. alanson for the very good moments he has given me with all of them.That said, I too think Joe should get laid more.",

Big Mining now has a firm grip on the mineral riches, and their economies of scale and resources make it almost impossible for the indie miner to survive.Now, he has two days before his ship will be repossessed unless he can find a miracle.And boy, does he find one.On a nameless hunk of rock, his sensors detect the faintest traces of, well . . . something.Not a human ship, but something alien. A long-running secret that upturns everything he’s always believed, one that could impact humanity’s very existence.Mankind always believed it was alone. Every probe it ever sent out beyond the Oort Cloud sent back the same results… except those were a lie, created to trick humanity into believing the galaxy was empty.But that was far from the truth.As the alien ship takes off and sends Wiz across the stars and out of the solar system, he soon discovers the universe is teeming with life. Empires are at war, countless species among them, and humanity has been left on the sidelines.The only question is, why? Why was humanity placed inside of a bubble?Join Wiz on his amazing journey of discovery, danger, and enormous stakes as he uncovers the secrets of the universe, so far from his home. From multiple Nebula and Dragon Award finalist and USA Today Bestselling author Jonathan P. Brazee comes a brand new scifi series unlike any before it.",

        "reviewDescription": "In terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, and format the editing is good.Pacing needs a drastic edit. I made it about half way though the book before I tapped out. Nothing happens. It’s just the two characters and brief appearances by others.And the problem is Wiz and his sidekick are just not interesting. We could cut somewhere between 30 and 60% of the book out and nothing of significance will be lost.The pacing is just agonizingly slow . I will not be finishing this book, or seeking anything else from the series.TL;DR skip this book.",

        "reviewDescription": "The Chaplain Corps of the US Navy serves time between Navy and Marine units. Twelve of my 24 years were \"green side\" from Vietnam to Desert Storm. The familiar \"faIr skies and following seas \" departure from an alien world deeply touched me. The same words were said at my retirement due to injury.  I did not serve at Tun Tavern in Philadelphia,  so I am not sure where the author decided to call an enlisted sailor a blue shirt.  As an officer on, above and below the sea the different shirts indicated special ratings or qualifications, especially on an aircraft carrier. Enlisted below the rank of Chief Petty Officer were usually called \"black shoe.\" Dress uniform for officers was a mandatory white from head to toe.  Using military occupation specialty numbers in the book allows me to tease 0311's with my favorite clean joke.  I was a Jewish chaplain who claimed that my MOS was designated ES.  When the usual came of never hearing that rating, my reply would be \"You never heard of Moses?\"",

    "bookDescription": "From the New York Times bestselling author of the Expanse comes a spectacular new space opera that sees humanity fighting for its survival in a war as old as the universe itself. ★ “Masterful . . . . This is space opera at its best.” – Publishers Weekly (starred review) \"The start of something truly epic.\" ― Fonda Lee, author of Jade City How humanity came to the planet called Anjiin is lost in the fog of history, but that history is about to end. The Carryx – part empire, part hive – have waged wars of conquest for centuries, destroying or enslaving species across the galaxy. Now, they are facing a great and deathless enemy. The key to their survival may rest with the humans of Anjiin. Caught up in academic intrigue and affairs of the heart, Dafyd Alkhor is pleased just to be an assistant to a brilliant scientist and his celebrated research team. Then the Carryx ships descend, decimating the human population and taking the best and brightest of Anjiin society away to serve on the Carryx homeworld, and Dafyd is swept along with them. They are dropped in the middle of a struggle they barely understand, set in a competition against the other captive species with extinction as the price of failure. Only Dafyd and a handful of his companions see past the Darwinian contest to the deeper game that they must play to survive: learning to understand – and manipulate – the Carryx themselves. With a noble but suicidal human rebellion on one hand and strange and murderous enemies on the other, the team pays a terrible price to become the trusted servants of their new rulers. Dafyd Alkhor is a simple man swept up in events that are beyond his control and more vast than his imagination. He will become the champion of humanity and its betrayer, the most hated man in history and the guardian of his people. This is where his story begins. \"Corey is always one of the most engaging voices in the genre.\" ― Adrian Tchaikovsky, author of Children of Time \"A bang up read. I want more.\" ― Paolo Bacigalupi, author of The Water Knife \"A powerful, provocative masterpiece that I will be thinking about for a very long time.\" ― Ryka Aoki, author of Light from Uncommon Stars",

        "reviewDescription": "Mercy of the Gods is a rare book that blends mythology, suspense, and human emotion in a way that pulls you in from the very first chapter. The story takes familiar themes of faith, morality, and power and presents them in a way that feels fresh without losing their timeless weight. What stood out most to me was not just the scale of the story but how real the characters felt. Even when larger than life forces were at play, their struggles, doubts, and choices were recognizably human.The pacing finds the right balance. There is enough tension and mystery to keep you turning the pages, but also quiet moments that make you pause and think about what mercy and justice really mean. The writing flows smoothly and offers depth that rewards you if you take the time to reflect on it.The strongest part for me was how it makes you think about our own world. Belief systems can guide, protect, or corrupt depending on who holds the power. It is entertaining, but also thought provoking in a way that stays with you long after you finish.If you enjoy stories that mix mythic scale with real emotional weight, Mercy of the Gods is absolutely worth reading.",

        "reviewTitle": "A New Epic Sci-Fi Series",
        "reviewDescription": "The Captive’s War is a new sci-fi series by the authors behind The Expanse, Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck, writing under the pen name James S. A. Corey. I have, obviously, read the whole Expanse saga, and watched the TV show too.While The Expanse is set in a near future, with Earth at the center, Captive’s War is set far into the future, distant from Earth, on a planet called Ajiin. (Maybe inspired by the Disney show Shogun, where the main character is called Anjin?)About 10% of the book is assigned to exposition, which isn’t a bad thing. After the first 10% it quickly gets very interesting.Enter the Carryx. An ancient species whose empire reaches across thousands of worlds. They are constantly at war, and much like the Borg, they do not kill all other species, instead they assimilate them into their society. Except those species that they find useless, of course. Those are eradicated like vermin.Humans, of course, are found useful to the Carryx, which is nice. Otherwise this would’ve become a very short book series.Beside a couple of anachronisms—like cigarettes and «spooling»—I found no mistakes in the book. This is rare. I used to work as a proofreader. The writers have done an excellent job, and I found the book hard to put down. The language is rich, the pacing exquisite, and the story unfolds in an entertaining and logical fashion. This is good storytelling. The Kindle book has also been properly formatted.To summarize, this is a promising start of something that can become truly epic, and maybe even bigger than the Expanse?",

        "reviewDescription": "I couldn't put this book down, and not just because I had Gorilla Glue on my fingers.  The first couple of chapters are pretty slow, but once the alien invasion starts (spoiler: there's an alien invasion) I was completely hooked.  The characters are pretty well fleshed-out and the sci-fi ideas are really interesting.  My only gripe is that they never bothered to even mention the wild coincidence of all of these alien species being similar in atmospheric and gravitational tolerance, not to mention the fact that they're all on relatively the same physical scale, ie: no microscopic beings or massive giants.  I'm nitpicking.  This was a heck of a lot of fun and I got through it 50-75 pages a night, having to force myself to put it down and go to sleep.  I'm really looking forward to Book 2.",

        "reviewDescription": "James S. A. Corey are great writers and story tellers. This book/series is even more ambitious than their wonderful The Expanse series. In this series they are attempting to create an alien world, in every sense of the phrase.  By necessity there is a lot of back story and picture painting in their words and it’s fascinating, but sometimes a bit slow.  I will definitely read this entire series.(Spoiler Alert!) Humans exist on a planet that is not earth, but have a remarkably similar existence. There is no explanation given for this setting.  About halfway through the book, they are conquered and enslaved by a completely alien race, and that’s where the book really gets interesting.  Our protagonist, Dafyd, is the only character who spends time trying to figure out the is alien race and is eventually rewarded for it by being appointed the leader of the humans.  The interesting aspect to this is how a young, lower status person gets put into that position.On top of that, there is another entity called the swarm, that inhabits some of the humans, while killing them, and incorporating them.  The swarm is from another alien race that is at war with the enslavers and is their spy. This is a fascinating construct and the interactions with the humans, both the hosts and their social circle is as rich tapestry as I have seen in a sci-fi book in a long time.  James  S. A. Corey has created something that is much more than a mere possession story.  The swarm is driven to get as much information as possible and to report it back to its home world , and is frustrated in its attempts to report.  It’s tough when you are living in an enslaved environment.As a whole book, it’s a little less than a whole stand alone novel.  As the beginning of a new series it is utterly captivating. I will anxiously await the next chapter.",

Fifteen hundred years ago, it declared its independence from the Imperium of Man, and paid the price. One loyal soul defied its treacherous rulers, and laid the world to waste. From these ashes emerged a unique fighting force, forged and tempered in nuclear fire…  Today, the Death Korps of Krieg lay siege to a captured hive city on the outskirts of the system-spanning Octarius War, in a desperate attempt to secure the cordon that stops untold masses of orks and tyranids from spilling out into the Imperium at large. The Korpsmen are relentless, ruthless, implacable and unstoppable, even in the face of a war that seems unwinnable. How far will they go to achieve victory, and is history doomed to repeat itself?",

Their history explained and paralleled in this book is well written, with great cast of characters from outside the Death Korps to paint the Kriegsmen in their own light and perspective. Overall a fun time and would recommend to anyone who’s into Krieg or even WWI style combat!",

        "reviewDescription": "I’ve loved the DKK for years built an army, read the few books, short stories that came out but this book is the best! It takes the known limited beginning and turns it from text book reading to actual story.  It must be hard to take a known and “set” beginning like you have for the Death Korps and make a book that passes the people at the Black Library and Forge world/ Game Workshop. They are so careful about what is done with “their “ universe.  Steve Lyons does a great job with the characters and battle scenes. The Death Riders are described very well and wish they were used more.  Maybe a second book on what happens durning the 500 years of continuous fighting on Krieg.  Now with DKK figures on GW website and not just Forge World $$$$$ more people will want to know more about their unbelievable warriors and not just as a Kill Team.  A must read for Death Korps of Krieg fans",

        "reviewDescription": "Esse livro é um dos poucos capazes de introduzir (por si só) um leitor novo ao aspecto verdadeiramente \"grimdark\" do universo de Warhammer 40k. Os outros são, em sua maioria absoluta, conduzidos por personagens que são exceções a regra. Grandes homens e mulheres, dedicados às suas funções por amor e dever e acima de seus contemporâneos e realizando feitos lendários (mesmo quando esquecidos), seja enquanto inquisidores da Santa Inquisição (Eisenhorn é um exemplo aqui), super soldados do Adetus Astartes, membros do Comissariado (Cain), como os technopriests do Adeptus Mechanicus  ou até mesmo funcionários do Adeptus Administratum.Neste livro, no entanto, temos personagens que são apresentados como a regra. Homens e mulheres comuns membros do Astra Militarum. Sem uma trama que envolva o colapso de sistemas, deuses do Caos ou conspirações extremamente complexas, os eventos deste livro são comuns ao universo de WH40K. São a regra nas fronteiras do Imperium. E a coragem e sacrifício dos homens e mulheres da Guarda, que morrem aos milhares (e milhões) todos os dias é apresentada como a fundação do Imperium: Sacrifício.O tema deste livro é no final das contas sacrifício e o bem comum, na ótica de homens comuns que lidam com a monstruosidade de um universo movido pela violência.Recomendado.10/10",

One of the mysterious characters is so, because it is very alien and has limited ability to communicate to the others.  The other mysterious characters are so because they don't know their own origins and have only know lives of abuse, ignorance, and terror.This is an excellent read.

With System Apocalypse, Monster Evo, and CardLit trending hard, it's nice to have a new entry in the core subgenre. Even better that it's enjoyable. This isn't a deep story, it's not hard sci fi, and it's not meant to be. Sometimes the best stories are simply enjoyable. That's what Gunboat is, enjoyable and simple.However I am concerned that Dean is limiting himself and his talents by sticking with the core subgenre, and I'd like to see him step out into other ideas and premises, especially after War Core.",

The tale flows smoothly and there is a clear level of thought put into the overall plot and story.  I should be able to fall into this tale and love it.But I can't and I can't for the standard reason I avoid tales with a dungeon core or other kind of system where the main character is a disembodied soul that has the ability to morph their surroundings and create minions that will defend them from enemies.  There is no character here.Not one.  Not the core, not his advisor, not the few talking minions that join, not even the enemy core he eventually converts into an ally.  None of them have character.  They exist as plot points.And I dislike stories that don't have real characters.  Worse, this story uses constant action to try to hide just how little character there is available.  It does make the story move, but it also means that there are no real moments where you get to know the characters, or the world.  There is clearly a world that was built in Dean's mind, but it doesn't come out on the pages or in the words, because the story never steps back long enough to really fall into that part of the story.This isn't bad, but I was reminded why I never finished the author's Derelict series which is set in the same universe.  There is just a lack of some elements that I consider required in any worthwhile story.",

Something massive. Something waiting.\nThe AI calls itself JUDGEMENT. It recognizes her authority. It obeys her verdicts.\nIn a world where the Meridian Corporation controls life through elevator licenses and oxygen quotas, one woman holds the key to a weapon that fires only when the law allows. Someone buried this warship for a reason. Someone powerful enough to rewrite history itself.\nAs corporate death squads close in and the body count rises, Josephine must decide: Is she liberating justice or unleashing judgment?\nWill she become the arbiter the oppressed need—or the executioner the powerful fear?\nDownload now to discover what verdict a warship renders when law meets tyranny.",

Medical way as in stopping a process such as a heart attack or stroke from a blockage.  Dystopia is familiar.  Answer is not. As in a few current books there is a problem with editing. Name of main character gets confused even with preview of next in series. Significant \"girl in red as in Spielberg \" gets muddled with names, places, parents, passing of drawings and most sadly the avenged death of the 47th floor. Also some confusion about rescued prisoners and employ throughout ship. These deleted from delight. My blame goes to beta readers.",

        "reviewDescription": "This book reads like two or more people took turns writing chapters without sharing their work with each other.  Sometimes the time lines are over 3 weeks, sometimes over years.  Dead characters make an appearance and then disappear.  A dead child and her equally dead father deliver a crayon drawing to the lead character and it is NOT in a dream sequence.  Every time the writing changed styles, I had to do a mental break and re-sync to the altered story.I enjoyed the story line, but this could have been much more enjoyable if had more consistency.",

        "reviewDescription": "Orson Scott Card’s “Children of the Fleet” focuses on Dabeet Ochoa, a 10-year-old arrogant savant living in Indiana who wants to leave the boredom of his life. His mother always told him that his father was in the International Fleet and so, after submitting his DNA for testing, he learns that his parentage entitles him to a place in Fleet School, the renamed Battle School following the Formic Wars, where children train to lead future colonial expeditions. The Minister of Colonization, Hyrum Graff, challenges Dabeet to figure out what he must learn to be a good leader.Taking place concurrent with the second and third books in the “Ender’s Shadow” series, the nations of the world are using their children who attended the Battle and Command Schools to prepare for war now that they no longer have the common enemy of the Formics uniting them. The attention on Dabeet makes him a target, leading to his kidnapping. He only convinces his kidnappers to return him by promising to get them into Fleet School at a later date, from which they can pressure the International Fleet to take an active peacekeeping role on Earth. His success at escaping his kidnappers earns him his spot in Fleet School, where he must make friends and figure out a way to prevent the people from kidnapping him from hurting the other students.The novel takes place roughly concurrent with “Shadow of the Hegemon” and “Shadow Puppets” and, while it is not necessary to have read those prior to this book, it certainly helps to understand the significance of Achilles to the events facing Ochoa (pg. 219). As the sixteenth book in the “Ender’s Game” series (seventeenth if one counts “First Meetings”), and following a trilogy about the First Formic War and the first book of a trilogy about the Second Formic War, Card takes the opportunity to help clean up some of the chronology, working in references to the Free Miners and Corporations (pg. 78), to Jukes Limited and its gravitic and Nan-Ooze technology, and to Victor Delgado and Imala Bootstamp (pg. 46). Further references help to tie-in “Ender in Exile”, as well. Those who enjoy Card’s writing will enjoy this, particularly for how it helps smooth out bumps in the chronology, but it will have less of an impact on the series than Card’s forthcoming “The Hive”, “The Queens”, and “Shadows Alive”.",

The distinctions set the stage for a deep and subtle exploration of extraordinary children and their triumphs and challenges.  Truly I think this book may be one of his best in terms of thoughtful character development.I’ve heard this book and intended series characterized as YA;  but I see no reason why this should be so.  Its witty, sophisticated and nuanced treatment of its subject matter makes this quite generally appealing:  suitable for parents and educators as well as old-school fans and new, younger readers.Highly recommended!jb",

        "reviewDescription": "A few years ago, I was blown away by Orson Scott Card’s classic, Ender’s Game. Since then, I’ve been in search of any book, which added life to the Enderverse and I wasn’t disappointed. Seems there are seven books in the Ender series (about the further adventures of Ender Wiggin). Then there’s five novels that make up the Shadow saga about another brilliant kid from Battle school named Bean. His stories run parallel to Ender’s and delve into Bean’s efforts to help save Earth from the aliens (or Formics) and itself. Sprinkled throughout these twelve books is the history of Ender’s and Bean’s families and how they intersect. Add to this mix, three books about the First Formic Wars (long before Ender’s birth) and a one novel (so far) about the Second Formic War. There are two more in this series that have not yet been published.Reading Orson Scott Cards work is always an intellectual experience with plot twists and well-rounded character development. Needless to say, I was overjoyed when I found that Children of the Fleet was available (which is set right after the events of the original Ender’ Game).I was quite excited to start reading but that was about the height of my excitement. Without hitting any spoilers, the story is about ten-year old Dabeet Ochoa who has the potential to become a great military strategist. The problem with the story begins once Dabeet is aboard the Battle Station (which is now a Fleet School for children training to be planetary explorers). At times, the characters conversations are repetitive and their thoughts are too long and drawn out. When Dabeet is faced with a particular life-and death training, a few pages are used to describe the young boy’s thoughts when a few paragraphs would have been sufficient. The bottom line is that there is so much unnecessary detail that it becomes boring.Perhaps Card is simply setting the stage for this new character to begin his adventures in possible new sequels but as a stand alone novel, Children of the Fleet is disappointing. Overall, the storyline is okay but not up to the level of the other series mentioned. I give the novel three stars.",

        "reviewDescription": "Card hat viele sehr gute Bücher geschrieben. Dies ist leider keins.Cards Stärken liegen meines Erachtens in seinen guten, witzigen Dialogen, den starken Charakteren und den Problemen, welche diese lösen müssen.Leider kommen keine dieser Stärken in diesem Buch zu tragen. Die Geschichte wird fast ausschliesslich aus der Sicht des unsympatischen Hauptcharakters Dabeet erzählt; dieser ist mehr oder weniger ein langweiliger Klon von Bean, der Probleme damit hat, die Sozialkompetenz eines Fünfjährigen zu erlangen. Der grösste Teil des Buches besteht aus innerem Monolog, in dem Dabeet unsinnige Annahmen hin- und herwälzt, ohne dass je irgendetwas spannendes passieren würde. Die Dinge, die tatsächlich geschehen, spielen für die Haupthandlung keine Rolle - beispielsweise findet Dabeet zwei geheimnissvolle Container im Frachtraum, die auf Schmuggel hindeuten, aber das spielt für den Rest der Handlung keine Rolle. Oder er untersucht mit anderen Kindern die Innereien der Station, was aber im weiteren Verlauf keine Konsequenzen hat. Oder er stellt bei einem Ausseneinsatz fest, dass die Battlerooms Todesfallen sind, findet es aber nicht wichtig, irgendjemanden davon in Kenntnis zu setzen, obwohl ein wichtiger Teil eines Plans, der in der Geschichte vorkommt, genau diese Orte betrifft. Die Haupthandlung wiederum macht überhaupt keinen Sinn, und zwar schon von Anfang an nicht. Um diesen Handlungsstrang aufrechterhalten zu können, muss Card ständig neue unglaubwürdige/lächerliche Elemente in die Handlung einführen.  Tiefpunkt der Glaubwürdigkeit ist die Entscheidung der hohen Vorgesetzten, die völlige Zerstörung der Raumstation zu riskieren und damit sämtliche Kinder und Personal der Raumstation absichtlich höchster Todesgefahr auszusetzen, ohne dass je ein vernünftiger Grund erwähnt würde, weshalb dieses Risiko eingegangen werden sollte.Alles in allem machen die vielen Unzulänglichkeiten dies wohl zum schlechtesten Buch, das Card je geschrieben hat.",

    "bookDescription": "Aboard his handpicked and recently renamed battleship, the Redemption, Grand Admiral Aatroxiss is sent to take command of the Frontier Fleet located in the outer rim of the galaxy, nearly a year's travel time away from the Imperial capitol of Kruko. His mission is a dual one, for he is also simultaneously the new Regional Governor of the scattered Imperial colonies there...a position that has never existed before.That's because the Frontier is a trash heap, and the Fleet stationed in it a collection of older ships with crews comprised of officers that the rest of the Empire didn't want. They're cast-offs exiled to die in service far from their homes in wars against numerous alien races that refuse to bend the knee to the Empire's continual expansion.Embarrassed and frustrated at the lack of progress, the Emperor turns to Aatroxiss, a known enemy of the Empire, and makes a deal to do what his own military commanders cannot...Bring order to the Frontier.So now Aatroxiss, hated by the Empire's propaganda machine in the minds of the military and civilians alike, must take command of a broken fleet and use his strategic mastery to begin mending the Frontier and preparing for a rumored invasion that the Emperor fears from beyond.Oh, and he also plans to overthrow the Empire when the time is right. That's pretty much out in the air between the two men, but for the moment their goals intersect and they reluctantly agree to work together for the benefit of the colonies in the Frontier.After that, all bets are off...",

His fresh start just turned into an interstellar conspiracy.\nAfter an undercover investigation goes bad, ex-soldier Evan hopes to forge a new life on a remote colony world. But when the transport ship explodes in orbit, his plans for a peaceful early retirement go out the airlock.\nHe crash-lands with a small group of settlers, away from the target site and with limited resources. Unable to call for help off-world, Evan and the mission's xenobiologist Anya race for survival in the dangerous wilds—until they realize they aren’t alone on the planet.\nEvan’s investigative instincts tell him that nothing about this colony mission going awry is an accident. When evidence points to an ancient alien starship hidden somewhere on the planet, he realizes that solving the mystery will be the biggest case of his life.\nCan Evan survive the hostile planet long enough to uncover the truth?\nStranded is the thrilling first installment in the Starship of the Ancients series. If you like suspenseful space adventures with dynamic characters, alien worlds, and escalating interstellar intrigue, then you'll love this riveting new space opera by author A.K. DuBoff, creator of the Cadicle Universe.\nGrab your copy now to discover the secrets of a new alien world!",

        "reviewDescription": "\"Stranded\" by A.K. DuBoff is the rare kind of “found alien spaceship” story that delivers on both intrigue and emotional depth. It opens with a tense escape from a failing colony ship and builds steadily into a layered plot involving survival, trust, and a conspiracy that feels fresh.The pacing is a true slow burn—never dragging, but taking the time to develop the characters. Evan, in particular, stood out to me for his believable decision-making and depth. The gradual trust between the two leads feels natural and earned, adding weight to their interactions.The world of Aethos is revealed piece by piece, with early details tying into the later story in satisfying ways. The setting balances accessibility with enough complexity to keep seasoned science fiction readers engaged, and the dialogue keeps the unfamiliar relatable.Greg Tremblay’s narration enhances the experience significantly. Each character has a distinct voice, and the delivery matches the tone of the scene—whether tense, reflective, or urgent. The production is clear and well-balanced, making it easy to stay immersed.Overall, \"Stranded\" offers well-crafted characters, thoughtful pacing, and world-building that pays off. The combination of strong storytelling and skilled narration makes this an excellent choice for listeners who enjoy character-driven science fiction with a mix of suspense and optimism.",

The character development is good, unfolding as the plot progresses with unsuspecting twists and turns of events. I read a number of good, well known authors who are creative in their story telling, but I cringe as  I read through a great deal of their material as its laced with vulgar references and gratuitous obscenities.  I find it distracting and in poor taste, but this author is not cut out of that regressive cloth. The author writes in such a manner that the content is fresh, creative and without the cringe worthy language and R rated scenes so prevalent in media today. I am interested in continuing to read the series after this first book.",

I won’t be reading the sequels and I’ll probably never think about this again.Good enough for a read if you are stuck on an airport and need to pass the time but can’t afford to be too engrossed with a book I’m case you missed your flight.Other than that, plenty of much better science fiction out there to read and enjoy.",

The planet is an odd one, but it does have large, dangerous fauna, the kind that might like to eat you.  Who shot the colony ship down?  And why?The hapless but plucky duo stumble from one catastrophic encounter after another.  There are alien artifacts involved, but also a dangerous crime cartel.  Our friends (unlike every other book I have read recently, the pair do no more than give one another longing glances.  That is probably a good idea.  This planet has too much going on for a sweet distraction.)  They make contact with a band of exiled revolutionaries just to make it even more complicated and dangerous.Fans of nonstop shooting and stabbing might find the world-building and character development too slow for their taste. Grown-ups will like this book plenty good.Recommended but not to everyone.",

Primarchs clash on the ravaged landscapes of Iax. The gods go to war, and the wider galaxy balances on a knife-edge of destruction. As something powerful stirs in the sea of souls, only one thing is certain – no matter who wins the last great clash of the Plague War, the repercussions of victory will echo through eternity…",

        "reviewTitle": "w40k advances at last!",
        "reviewDescription": "(spoiler free) Kudos to Guy Haley and the GW team for advancing W40k at last!I'll preface this by saying the roots of grimdark are clear.  When W40k was developed in the 80's, the central concept of warfare was stagnation, ala Viet Nam, WWI, or the Cold War.  Thus, nothing changed substantially in the \"Long War\".  There were no \"good guys\"; nihilism is core to the setting.Stagnation is unfortunately ... boring.  Starting with 8th edition and the Gathering Storm series, GW made the choice to retain grimdark elements while allowing heroes and villains, and an actual dynamic story where progress is possible.This pays off substantially in GodBlight.  Guy Haley takes the Dark Imperium series, as well as tie-ins from the Psychic Awakening, The Great Work novel, and the Dawn of Fire series, and delivers with a great pay off.ProsOverall plot progress at last!  We find out what happened between the Emperor and Guilliman, etc.  The Psychic Awakening has a purpose.Non space marine characters are interesting and compelling, especially demons and humans.There are multiple, interesting discourses on the nature of godhood.  Is godhood due to innate properties, or does it require attribution from others?  How much is perception?  How important is faith?  These questions are handled in an intelligent way that advances the story.ConsSpace Marine characters, despite valiant effort, are generally boringGuilliman is portrayed as a master strategist, but his plans are incredibly simple and easily thwartedRequest greater change amongst the primarchs.

At over 400 pages long, it took awhile to finish, but is definitely worth every penny.",

        "reviewDescription": "I thoroughly enjoyed the Dark Imperium Trilogy. There was plenty of Astartes action and Boltguns roaring.. but the best parts of the series were the characters we got to know along the way and the interwoven stories they had to tell.The characterization of the Primaris alongside the First-born was really well done, the Death Guard and the Daemons of Nurgle were wonderfully accurate and well written. Mortarion and Typhus were brilliant, especially when they butted heads. The Sororitas and the Silent Sisters were fantastic.  Guilliman, centre stage, was excellent. Especially when he was struggling with the potential truth of the Emperor being a God. Speaking of which, when the Emperor acted through Guilliman in the Garden or Nurgle, that was insane to witness!I highly recommend this trilogy to any fan of Warhammer 40,000 (and the Horus Heresy) or just Science Fiction in general. 10/10.",

It seemed to fit the mix of species that there would be formally correct phrasing of the ‘universal language’.Enjoyable enough.",

Not all ‘and’s between parts of a sentence require a comma.The story line is puerile, difficult to ascertain until halfway through the book. The initial premise is intriguing.

Son of the Emperor, brother of demigods and primarch of the Dark Angels.  Awakened. Returned. And yet lost.  After ten thousand years, Lion El'Jonson finds himself trapped in the nightmare of Imperium Nihilus, where the dying embers of humanity are threatened on all sides by the darkness. Alone, he has no hope of prevailing against this evil. However, there are those who would aid him in this quest. Hunted to the edge of endurance, his fallen knights have long awaited the day their liege would return to redeem them. Now he must gather them to his side once more, and ride out to vanquish a traitorous son and his twisted Chaos warband.  And yet in these strange times the Lion can be certain of nothing and no one except for himself. But without the Emperor, without the Imperium, without his Legion and without Caliban… who is he?",

        "reviewDescription": "Lion, Son of the Forest is a fantastic book and definitely worth reading if you're interested in Warhammer 40k or just science fiction stories in general. The novel reads well, action scenes are exciting and slower scenes are given time to breathe which allows for solid character building as well as building up atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere, the descriptions of locations in the book are nicely detailed but not overly detailed to where it feels like you're getting bogged down in them. You will likely want to know a bit about the basic setting of 40k, but you aren't required to be a lore buff to enjoy the story, and the story does a good job of giving enough pretext so you're not thrown into the deep end and expected to swim. There are genuinely heartwarming (at least to me) moments in here which I wasn't really expecting but nonetheless enjoyed, and some humor sprinkled in as well.In closing I'd recommend this book to anyone that is interested in Warhammer 40k or enjoys a good sci-fi story.",

I promise you it isn't necessary.If you have a passing interest in the game lore and have maybe watched a few youtube videos and have wiki near you that is all you will need to understand the context of the book.The book itself I thought was very well written and reads very fast.  It is very action packed with not much downtime.  If you are a newcomer like myself, the best way I can describe the book its kind of like a really great standalone comic book hero movie; in book form.  The way the Lion wakes up gathers his senses and finds and leads his son all the while leading and protecting those around him, definitely gives you a sense of heroism.I'd highly recommend whether you are new to the universe or not.",

        "reviewDescription": "There never has been a more honest, visceral, raw and hilarious look into the Grim Darkness of the Far Future. Even though near the end of the second act the Orks take a back seat, it all pays off when we return to them. These comedic menaces are fantastic, just as Mork and Gork intended. Princess is the loyal puppy we all want, and Mitranda is a ruthless tactical, yet humane character for all their upgrades.I also like that they avoid using the weird 'vis' pronoun and instead Mike uses 'they' as pronouns when referring to the Battle Leader.We get emotional moments from the Mechanicus, we get backstabbing from all parties, and we get the greatest ways to kill Titans ever seen. Even if you're not a fan or Orks, Mechanicus or Chaos, you will enjoy this masterpiece of English literature.",

Ich hatte mich immer wieder bei dem Gedanken erwischt: \"Ja, der Ork hat verdammt noch mal recht. Warum sind da humies so humie? Warum nicht Probleme direkt lösen, sondern alles so umständlich machen?\"Ich hatte schon lange nicht mehr so gelacht beim Lesen eines Buches.

But he has other problems, like the people trying to extort him into capturing a man he was probably going to kill anyway! Now, with bounty hunters, crime lords, their own Navy, and some random gunslinger after them, can Brad and Jessica find a little more dumb luck and save each other and their crew? Old villains return, and new friends are forged as they scramble against the worst odds they've ever seen.Meanwhile, there are a lot more people in the Star Kingdom of Prometheus plotting against our heroes, and Brad and Jessica will discover that they're part of something so big and dangerous that they might wish they really did die back when the government said they did.The seventh book in the exciting and fan-favorite Dumb Luck and Dead Heroes series, The Worst Fugitives in the Star Nation will make you cheer (for sure), laugh (almost certainly), and cry (probably) as you follow our hapless heroes through another romp across the galaxy! Space opera meets military sci-fi and humor in this glorious story of flawed people stepping up to do heroic things.Order today!",

        "reviewTitle": "Another awesome read in a fantastic series",
        "reviewDescription": "Another awesome book in a series I can't get enough of since picking up the first book. This one had a lot more going on, still an amazing and fast-paced read. The characters slowly build up their depth over the 7 books, with still some details unknown. The action in space and on the ground is well written. It's got more in-depth in the battle and fight \"scenes\" as the series has expanded, and it feels like the author has evolved in a sense of taking an idea for a novella into a fully fledged novel that keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting more.It's quickly become one of my favourite series, and I hope there's a lot more to come.The only problem is now I have to wait 3 months before I can read the next in the series, and then even longer to read whatever comes next. I hope the author is forgetting about sleep, and has his pen to the paper (or most likely keys to the keyboard) and gets cracking on bringing us more of the luckiest heroes in the galaxy.",

    "bookDescription": "Being a sentient spaceship really should be more fun. But after spreading out through space for almost a century, Bob and his clones just can't stay out of trouble. They've created enough colonies so humanity shouldn't go extinct. But political squabbles have a bad habit of dying hard, and the Brazilian probes are still trying to take out the competition. And the Bobs have picked a fight with an older, more powerful species with a large appetite and a short temper. Still stinging from getting their collective butts kicked in their first encounter with the Others, the Bobs now face the prospect of a decisive final battle to defend Earth and its colonies. But the Bobs are less disciplined than a herd of cats, and some of the younger copies are more concerned with their own local problems than defeating the Others. Yet salvation may come from an unlikely source. A couple of eighth-generation Bobs have found something out in deep space. All it will take to save the Earth and perhaps all of humanity is for them to get it to Sol — unless the Others arrive first.",

It brings all the threads from the previous two books to their conclusion.The series is well written and well edited with several interesting plot lines and characters that are more than just cardboard.  The books are fun and fairly quick reads. While not pretentiously philoshical, the Bobiverse books do have some thought provoking elements around what it means to be human and what “self” might mean if personality could be cloned.  I really appreciate that the author has a point or two to make along with all the well-crafted action scenes.Given the low price (potentially free if you’ve subscribed to the Kindle Unlimited program) I didn’t have super high expectations for the series, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Mr. Taylor is a first rate author and I’m looking forward to reading whatever he writes next.",

        "reviewTitle": "The best of the three books and a grand finale",
        "reviewDescription": "After book two, I went into Book 3 with some reservations.Dennis Taylor definitely delivers in Book 3.I have the advantage or the disadvantage of writing this review after a lot of other folks (as opposed to the Others) have written reviews.Here is a quick summary (without spoilers).  Bob learns to embrace what he has become, and not what he was.  The Bob-i-verse is all about doing whatever you want without time constraints and few physical limitations.  Bob is no longer human, and in this book he embraces what he might be in all of its variegated forms.By the end of the book, the major plot issues (minus one) from the previous books have been addressed in a final way, and you are reasonably happy with where the author leaves things off.While there could be further books in the Bob-i-verse, it seems unlikely, and as a reader, I am fine with where things are left.A little more meaty review follows.** Beware good reader, spoilers this way lie **Now to respond to a few criticisms of the book by other reviewers.(1) The timeline is confusing.  Yes, you're right.  It certainly can be.  I listened to the audiobook version and did not have a piece of paper handy to write down times and events, but that probably would have been useful.  At times, I had to stop the book audio and think, \"that does not make sense in light of last chapter,\" and then realize that the events of the last chapter did not happen yet for the Bob in this chapter.  Given that there were several hundred Bobs by the end of the book and they were spread across several thousand cubic light-years, it would have been tough to portray unless Dennis had done it \"Game of Thrones\" style.  A few chapters are done that way, the ones surrounding the battle at Earth include several chapters that occur near simultaneously.(2) The battle with the Others and the final solution of the Others is anti-climactic.  Um, you have not sold me on this one.  The entire book leads up to the big battle in Sol, and in a way, Bob is both clever and lucky to win against the Others in Sol.  Bob's cheaty knowledge of physics comes to the rescue, and Dennis does remind us repeatedly that the Others are very arrogant.  The Bobs very nearly lost the battle for Sol.As to the final destruction of the Others in their home system, the \"Hail Mary\" play is telegraphed in an early chapter, and every so often we return to the pair of Bobs on the crazy mission.  We know that the Others have only colonized one system, and if that system can be wiped out then they are done.The solution, hurl planets into their sun at true relativistic speeds and cause a nova, is a fairly clean, scientific approach as opposed to space opera, but it makes sense in light of the Bob-i-verse, and Dennis did leave us some hints in the earlier books.(3) Bob would not just abandon humanity at the end of the book.  Yes, that seemed a bit implausible to me too.  That said, all the Bobs did not leave humanity.  Some stayed around to patrol the skies around the colonies.  Some continued to work on biospheres.  Other Bobs raised families.  All in all, it seemed reasonable that some of the Bobs would head out to explore new worlds.Those were the main objections I saw.In this book, the Others are beaten at Sol (barely), and their home system is destroyed by causing their sun to nova.Bob moves on from Eden after living for twenty years as a Deltan in an android body.  Once his last Deltan friend dies, Bob is ready to move on from mortality.  Bob's lack of a family as a human drives him to seek closure for the family need in the early part of his immortality.  This arc made sense to me.There is only one additional replicant made, and that is one of Bob's human sweethearts.  The book explains that serving mankind in the afterlife seems like a burden.  So, ipso facto, no one wants to become a replicant.I'm not sure that I buy that.  Dennis deals with religion obliquely and mostly negatively.  If you eliminate a religious afterlife then my gut says that many, many people would seek to live on as replicants.  No strike, no foul though.There were plenty of Bobs by the end of the book.Yes, true, Dennis never did eliminate the evil Brazilian replicants.  Yes, that is an annoying, hanging thread, but the Bob-i-verse is robust and more than able to deal with the one annoying antagonist.At the end of the book, in the final Moot, the Bobs essentially agree that they no longer feel obligated to defend humanity.  It is a non-binding resolution, just a general feeling that is codified and passed along to the human colonies.  Still, at the end of the book, there are still many Bobs working on helping humans out.The last scene is of original Bob visiting the ice covered glacier that was Las Vegas and bidding farewell to Bill and Will, his first copies.By the end of the final chapter, Dennis had closed out the Bob-i-verse, and I was OK with saying good-bye.That is a fine way to end a trilogy.Well done Dennis!",

This was exactly the type of series I was looking to read and the rest of the series is just as good.  I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good space based sci fi series to read.Warning:  SpoilersThe conflict between the Bobs and the Others was a little cliche, but the author made it unique and did a good job of it.  It does rely a bit on other sci fi work and pop culture references, but makes up for it with the well researched theoretical science.  The mix of conflict, exploration, and a variety of threats that the main characters had to face was great.  The main concept of the replicants and the continuous debate about them throughout the series was very well thought out.  The only parts that I did not like about the series was the extreme focus that Bob-1 has on the Deltans and his non-existent involvement in the conflict with the Others.  I also wish that the story had led to the Bobs discovering another peaceful space based intelligent species, maybe shortly after their victory with the Others, but it was still a good ending.  Again, highly recommend for sci fi enthusiasts.",

        "reviewDescription": "I had a great time with this one.it was well written, fast paced and i loved the different story archs off all the bobs.I wasn't ready to \"finish\" the trilogy, because i already have the 4th book in my possession and thought that there will be a continuation of this particular narrative, but the way this book ends has a feeling that this is the conclusion of the story.I jumped straight into reading this one after finishing the second one, but I doubt I'll keep on going, like I said, it feels like a conclusion of sorts.I would love to see some more Deltan evolution because that is what is so fun about speculation and evolution, but this book signs off nicely regarding that aspect.A bit of a spoiler...I did feel like defeating the others was a bit too \"easy\" and simple at the end, but I'm still OK with that.All in all, its a good read, fun and quick and nice to run through it.",

Having finally read the authors notes after book four, I realized I really like Mr. Ramirez’ style and dedication to telling a clean story that even his kids could enjoy. I am delaying my move to something outside of this story simply because it’s that good. Excellent reading for any avid reader, regardless of age or education level.",

The guy gets tortured for five weeks and lets the person who instigated it leave unharmed.It's hard to pin down the style here. On one hand, the \"good guy never killing unless fired upon first and sparing his enemies where possible\" trope is strictly sunday morning cartoonery, but then dealing with rape, torture, PTSD, parental abuse and such are all far more mature themes.Still, I want to give five stars because I understand that the algorithm punishes anything less, and if people want to read this and have fun doing it despite what I've mentioned (which is mostly a personal taste thing) then have at it.",

        "reviewDescription": "FULL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT:I am a huge fan of Craig Martelle’s ability to tell a story and hold one’s interest.  BUT…I despise (loathe might be more accurate) the military opera genre.  I have never found it to be interesting.  When I want to read about the military I prefer to read non-fiction material.So, that being said, I probably would not have picked this book up had I not been following Craig on FB.  One unkind comment prompted me to pick it up and take a look. I should have known better because I was hooked almost instantaneously.We don’t really come to “love” these characters, even though we get to know a lot about each of them, rather I would say we come to love this TEAM, instead.  As an aggregate whole they most definitely surpass the sum of the individual parts.  Although I, myself, have never served, this seems particularly appropriate for a story focused on the military.If, you’re a long-time Craig Martelle fan, you’re in for a real treat.  It may only be my opinion, but it has seemed to me that the first one or two books in any of the series he has written are a bit of “choppy water,” until he gets his sea-legs for that particular storyline.  This put me off reading his work for quite a while. Not so, this story!Again, bearing in mind how I feel about the military fiction genre, imagine my shock at being grabbed and pulled into this story within 5-10 paragraphs.  The LEAST he could have done was provide a warning to keep our hands in the car at all times and remain seated until it comes to a full-stop, cause this book is a rollercoaster ride.Finally, returning to my baseball analogy, I’ll admit I wasn’t enthralled with a 9th Inning Substitution, but I’ll withhold judgment until we see if this player can catch the ball.  Time will tell.Regardless, pick this book up, take a seat, hold on  (remember, he omitted the public safety warnings), and ENJOY!",

        "reviewDescription": "7/10 This is a well written space opera. Sure it's a little clichéd and predictable but the characters are relatable and I cared about what was happening on every page. There's just a touch of humanistic almost politically correct irrationality in spots and the mind-reading concept presents a few disparities but neither issue is more than a minor distraction.The conversation formatting is a bit of a mess. Improper use of quotation marks and inadequate description of who is saying what to whom at which time often creates quite a bit of confusion trying to figure out exactly who is talking.Likewise many of the battle descriptions are a muddled mess but it's quite difficult trying to describe maneuvering and exchanging volleys in the 3D environment of space.Overall this is a very entertaining read. The plot moves along quickly and I was thoroughly invested in the story. I'm jumping right into the next one.",

Back then, everything was still fantasy. But I was hooked. Over the years, I've come not just be a reader, but to involve myself as part of the story to be taken away. I discovered thus book purely by happenstance while surfing for something to read while waiting for something else to be delivered.  This book is fast paced with believable characters. There is no drag in the storyline. Having served in the military, as the author tells us he did, I find the interaction between the primary characters to  be somewhat truthful. As a Vietnam combat veteran, I find the nicknames given to be about on par when serving in a small unit. Everyone had to be known by something. The language in this book could be toned down a tad, but having served in a front line unit, I've known it to be worse. Not sure what the target audience is, but I'm guessing late teens to early adult. Overall, I liked the book. I found it to hold my interest enough to pre-order book #2.  I've also perused the authors other series in the Kindle store. You can't go wrong with this first installment.",

The AI inhabiting Leviathan is nearly as entertaining as Skippy from the Expeditionary Force series.  Team Payne is a motley group, but eminently endearing.  The science is covered very well and believable.  Character development is top rate, showing how a disparate group of highly opinionated military spacers can gel to make a formidable force.  Dialogue between the members is profane, irreverent, crude, and absolutely hilarious.  The concept of a pacifist warship is quite interesting, along with the mental/electronic gyrations it goes through to justify its use of force.  Really looking forward to the second book, but hoping some editing is accomplished before release.  Last thought, there is NO SUCH WORD as “ginormous”.",

I have since been reading about anything I can get my hands on.This book has a different writing style and the material is not stale.  The characters are developed. He establishes the characters to be persons of character. It is a military based read with a goal of peace for those being protected.  It’s a hero’s journey.  And in amongst the characters development there are things that go boom.  It is not a boring read.",

Sadly, this book seems to be written by a 13year old.What I really appreciate is good world building, when the words paint me a picture, and I get to know the situation as well as the people involved, as you get from masters like James S.A.Corey, Peter F. Hamilton or Alastair Reynolds. This book does not care for any of that. It hurries through its story, does not expand on or explain anything, no-one acts in a believable way, every character is just a very basic stereotype and the heroes do their utmost to be cool as hell and engage in never-ending banter that feels embarrassing while reading it.For military SF better pick up the works of Jack Campbell or Glynn Stewart.",

    "bookDescription": "The Bedlam Galaxy lies at the heart of the Laniakea Supercluster and is a focal point for all of the wormhole transits spanning that great expanse. Among the many races drawn to and inhabiting its 10,000+ stars, humanity is one of the most recent and longest anticipated additions. Once nearly driven to the brink of extinction by violent and irreconcilable gender divides within the dominant cultures of their homeworld, new technologies emerged to save the species from their own folly and helped propel them into a new age of interstellar exploration. Inevitably, that drive into the stars led to the discovery of their own wormhole transit at the edge of the solar system, and from there they ran straight into the waiting arms of Bedlam's great multi-species intergalactic trade and defense alliance, known colloquially as the Alliant.Vahkis Greye was born a century after those treaties were signed, but such lofty things held little interest to the son of a poor asteroid miner and his synthetic companion. All Greye wanted out of life was to make enough coin to open his own service and repair shop somewhere in the galactic rim, where his talents were really needed and would be appreciated. No more bouncing between odd jobs on far-star space stations, outer-system asteroid mines, and deep space hauler lanes. He wanted a place he could call home, and after two decades of scrimping and saving every last coin he earned, he finally had just enough for tuition to an accredited Systems Repair Tech simulatorium and the rare and expensive Adjustable Hard Light Projection multi-tool required to complete it. Degree in one hand, A.H.L.P in the other, Greye thought he might finally have a shot at his dream.Unfortunately, the universe had other plans.An unexpected early-morning service call from one Captain Rita Mari of the Prison Ship Sheol arrived with an offer he literally couldn't refuse. Within hours the unlucky technician found himself alone and trapped aboard an un-crewed and mortally damaged Megalith Class Supercarrier surrounded by violent gangs of murderous female inmates, hounded by a genocidal race of alien shock troopers, demonized and hunted by his own kind, and welcome pretty much nowhere within the galactic spiral.All he'd ever wanted was to be left alone with his reasonable little dream of repairing the space ships he'd always found so interesting. Instead, fate threw him into a situation so absurd even a life-long survivor of the worst hives of scum and villainy the Rim had to offer cannot see a way out of it.At least not without help.Be forewarned! In addition to bawdy action-filled adventures, criminal hijinks, and the occasional exploration of dark and heavy topics, this series contains depictions of alien morality and cultural norms, as well as relationships that could be considered non-traditional... you know, for humans.",

        "reviewDescription": "I have to say that this book really surprised me. I found it on Reddit and couldn't help but be drawn to it due to the many praises it received and the really interesting premise. The only thing that I thought might be slightly off-putting was the whole feminist thing, but I was pleasantly surprised with how it was portrayed.I've been feeling slightly burned out when it comes to reading books in the harem genre due to the artificial feeling many create when introducing more characters into the relationship dynamic, so when I was reading this, it felt like I was reading one of the few books that produce a genuine feeling of freshness within me.Either way, I like pretty much everything about this series: the fact that there are genuine consequences that happen as a result of the main character's actions and circumstances (e.g., injuries aren't just shrugged off and have hindered him throughout almost the whole book), the whole harem actually makes sense given the situation the MC's been dropped into and how the environment has shaped the people on board the ship, and the characters were charming and had personalities that meshed really well and each felt unique; the grammar and spelling were pretty spot on (there were a couple of instances of extra-long spaces though).Side note: I really liked the intro: it gave a great look into human society in the universe without being boring in any way, while also establishing the MC's personality and establishing the differing perspectives when it comes to the whole gender and class issue (e.g., rave sections and graduation ceremony). Also, I ended up liking this book so much that I decided to actually put my money behind this series, so keep up the great work :)!",

The female characters are not cutouts, but have personalities and quirks, and help move the story along.  (Although the MC does spend a lot of his time appreciating their physical attributes.)As the title states, the ship in the story is a prison ship, with an all female crew and all the prisoners are female.  The male MC is brought aboard to perform a single repair, but while onboard the ship is attacked, forcing the MC to leap in to try and save lives, and to repair the ship to save all their lives.The story ends with a cliff-hanger, one in which i feel ignores an important part of the story told.  I'll wait for eagerly for the sequel to see if that is explained.",

        "reviewTitle": "I HUNGRILY await the next book, let alone the next four!",
        "reviewDescription": "Honestly, I came across this book and didn't think much of it at the time. I had only grabbed this as part of filling out my borrows under K.U. after finishing off all of the Murderbot Diaries series by Martha Wells, another great sci-fi series to read while you're waiting for more of this one. This has been the single fastest turnaround from curiosity to full blown interest, I don't think I've made a faster book purchase in my life. I am absolutely in love with this book, from the incredibly snarky, tongue-in-cheek humor of the copyright notice at the beginning of the book that acknowledges fellow men of culture, to riotous funny comments and quips from the generous variety of distinct characters spread thoughout the story. The action honestly had me hounding each page for every riveting moment, both the good and the bad, coming across as fast paced as a bullet train led by a conductor on hopes, dreams and cocaine. I'm not usually one to write reviews for ANYTHING, if EVER, but any good reader worth their salt should take the time to at least read the first few chapters of this book, it's FREE fer Christ's Sake! It's not often I find a book that makes me never want to put it down, let alone forget that I'm reaching the end of the last few pages, but even if this wasn't science fiction, there's a magic here that'll draw you in, one that can and will grab you like few else ever will. For a first book in a series, Nick, you have well and truly exceeded all expectations of the genre and overcome the cliched tropes ever so present within the latest books in many genres, BRAVO, my friend, for You have surpassed the limits of traditional literature and created something ALIVE, a living, breathing piece of some damn fine storytelling. Now for the rest of you lot, get yourself into the book already before I throw you near light speed into the accretion disk of the next  black hole!",

        "reviewDescription": "I like how this author balances story and smut; some authors go way too heavy on the smut to compensate for a weak story, but in this case the smut is flavoring for a solid action/adventure. The main character is intelligent and thinks with his brain more than his reproductive system, and I appreciate that he isn't a pushover. For example, there is a scene with a succubus that could be construed as sexual assault, and the main character calls the girl out on it before making his next decisions based on logic and situational necessities (this may seem obvious, but I've read trash books where the main character either doesn't care or is too whipped to stand up for himself). The writer's prose is enjoyable and all the technical details (grammar, spelling, etc) were solid. I hope to see more from this author in the future. Wish for future: I would like to have chapters from an alternate point of view every now and then to develop the girls' characters. Criticism: I feel that the baddies are too one-dimensional; there is no logic to some of the torture in the prison other than as a big neon sign saying \"the baddies are evil\".",

Wraight leans into the Norse aspects of the Space Wolves heavily, making them a lot less cartoonish than some of the past representations have (  Santa Grimmnar on his wolf sled is a good example). The story has plenty of bolter porn action, void combat, heroic stands against long odds, etc. Basically, it's full of everything you could want if you picked up a book about space Vikings. Some previous knowledge about the 40k universe helps, but it's not required. A fun, fast read that's worth your time if you're a fan.",

There is also the description of relationships, both human and inter species and lots of laughter, both human and alien. The characters, all of them, are portrayed vividly. The plot is straightforward, and the premise is basically stopping a score of aliens who are too stupid to leave the \"Ender of Wars\" alone. I definitely highly recommend this book and the entire series. I have enjoyed it immensely, so far!",

        "reviewDescription": "The series is fun - kind of a bag of chips for the mind with very shallow character development and Lost in Space meets Orville type storytelling but entertaining nonetheless to pop sci-fi fans.  That said, I am downrating this particular volume since it seemed rushed, with a lot of grammatical errors and what almost seemed like a chunk missing around why the Munchkins were collected from the mining station and brought to the Nest.  The writing style of constantly nesting topics (interrupting the action with a subplot and then another and another) makes it sometimes difficult to keep track of what’s going on.  Will continue the series and hoping it gets more polished.",

The Warmaster Horus’ bloody seven-year crusade has led to this: the cradle of mankind, where he is to kill his father, the Emperor. With the war at this critical juncture, Sanguinius, primarch of the loyalist Blood Angels, braves the horrors of the Warmaster’s flagship, The Vengeful Spirit, with a single purpose in mind: to slay his brother Horus, decapitate the Heresy once and for all, and stop the forces of Chaos from taking Holy Terra. But at the whim of a Warmaster fallen so far from grace, the Dark Gods will not make Sanguinius’ task an easy one, and as the war edges towards its explosive, bloody conclusion, events are about to unfold that could either save humanity, or plunge it headlong into an eternity of darkness.",

The siege becomes a siege on the very concept of humanity, our very best and worst natures laid bare. A work that is the culmination of many hands and many ideas should feel consequential, and Siege doesn't disappoint and The End and the Death trilogy stands above it's worthy peers in the series. I wouldn't start reading unless you have a very free day, because you'll find the work enthralling and lose sense of time (perhaps a metaphysical spillover of un-time from the work in question?).",

I really enjoy the Horus Heresy series and the Siege of Terra is no exception. There is great writing on all sides of the conflict. My only regret is that Horus takes a backseat in the story in this particular volume. Hopefully he comes back center stage in vol 3.",

        "reviewTitle": "Pares down the fluff from the 1st book and presses the peddle to the metal!",
        "reviewDescription": "Disregard that 1 star review from some whiner complaining and spoiling the novel for everyone else. It was written by someone who already decided beforehand that he hated this book. Just another 40k edgelord who can only complain about what *he* doesn't like and tries to ruin the game/lore/hobby for everyone else. We all know this type... he's a \"that guy\".Let's break it down, *without spoilers* as that's the appropriate approach. Obviously I'm going to take for granted that everyone knows that the Emperor is mortally wounded and the loyalists win a pyrrhic victory against Horus and Chaos. This battle is how the entire setting for the 40k universe is brought about. It's no secret. What these books (and all of the Horus Heresy novels) are doing is giving us incredible detail as to how exactly the 40k universe becomes what it is.Ok, that said, the first half of this book is *much* more about the supporting cast of characters than the 1st book. Malchador and the Emperor feature far less (though the Emperor does show up near the end for an epic, and sad, reveal) and with Malchador being almost entirely consumed by the Golden Throne his chapters are often nothing more than short, broken thoughts. More time is given to characters like Fo & Amon, John, Oll and the Companions, Rann, Azkaellon and the Astartes who were trapped outside after the Eternity Gate closed, Amit and the \"Denial Companies\" set up to defend the inner sanctum, Dorn who continues to try and figure out a way to get free from Khorne's trap, and finally Sanguinius in all his glory. Lastly, for brief chapters (all the chapters are extremely brief... maybe 10 pages at most, most are only 2 - 4 pages), the Emperor, Valdor and the few remaining Custodes. Valdor is perhaps the one with the least amount of \"screen time\", showing up for a couple chapters early on and then never brought up again. There's a decent amount of time given to the Emperor in the first quarter, then nothing for a long portion, only to show up near the end for some *really* important moments. Perhaps some of the most important moments in the entire storyline, outside of Sanguinius death and the final clash between Him and Horus.The first half can generally be split into 3 sections; outside the Palace, inside the Palace and the Vengeful Spirit. There's one aspect of this book that permeates every part and it's actually really wonderfully done, and that is the warp's complete breakdown of spacetime and geometry. The outside and inside of the palace quickly becomes meaningless... it's both and neither at the same time but I'm sticking to the inside & outside designation to just make it easy. It started to happen during the 1st book but it *really* takes off in this one. *Nobody* is where they intend to be, not even the traitors. It can be subtle, like a winding staircase becoming counter-clockwise when it should have been clockwise, or entire structures (like a certain infamous prison) simply appearing dozens of kilometers away from where they should be. Characters frequently walk through one door only to appear impossibly far away from where they should be, sometimes not even on Terra any more. Even the inner sanctum is succumbing to the warp, making the nigh-unshakable Custodes feel unnerved (well, as close to unnerved as they can get).One thing is definitely certain though; the end of all things is imminent. Vulcan is even counseled to enact the \"Seven Hammers\" protocol, which will destroy the Golden Throne and all of Terra. The Dark King finally manifests itself, throwing everyone who looks upon it (on one side at least) into pure fright, yes even Astartes, and madness as they flee from it. Erebus shows up, chasing after John & his companions and really puts a hurt on the group. Abaddon very nearly kills him and I really wish he did. Erebus is just the absolute worst. Luckily for the loyalists, and once again thanks to the warp, time has stopped as well (which really pisses off the Dark Mechanicus as all of their machines start to fail). The first quarter of the book really dives in and drives home that nothing is proper and nothing can be trusted. Not senses, not direction, nothing. Orders are relayed on scribbled paper and run between units like a WW1 trench runner (but on jet bikes), dataslates and vox commo are long abandoned. *Nobody* is in communication with anyone from the Anabasis boarding party on the Vengeful Spirit *except* one could maybe make the argument for the 9th legion Astartes who constantly \"dream\" in their battle-weary fugue states of Sanguinius as he progresses through the ship in low orbit (obviously this tenuous, dream-like connection will be *VERY* important later on).Speaking of Sangunius, the 1st half deals with him and his personal guard fighting through the ranks of traitors to reach Horus. After that grueling battle, he is cut off from his guard and \"lost\" in darkness. Eventually *someone* shows up (not gonna say who) and helps guide Sanguinius out of the darkness and eventually to Horus. The final battle between Horus and Sanguinius is... well, it felt underwhelming to me. This is another instance where the outcome is no secret. Horus kills Sanguinius and while yes, it's sad, it's not as moving as I expected it to be. Maybe my own hype for this moment was built up too much (I mean, their battle is literally on the cover so I feel like *everyone* was hyped for this moment) but it didn't land like I expected it to. It's still wonderfully written and Abnett even made me think for a moment, \"Wait, is Sanguinius going to win this fight?\" even though it's already been well documented for many decades now that he doesn't. It was a joy to read Sanguinius actually start to piss Horus off and truly hurt him too, but we all know how it end and it ends... fast. Once Horus is able to actually catch him, he lands (basically) two blows and that's all he wrote. The first one cripples Sanguinius, the second kills him. I wanted it to be more emotional for me than it really was. Honestly, the reveal of the Dark King, the conversation (it) has with a certain character and the realization of what (it's) doing and what will happen because of (it's) decision, was more impactful for me than the fight between Horus and Sanguinius.The book suffers from the same issues the 1st one did, though not as bad, which is Abnett's *extreme* verbosity. I swear, I had to look up more words in the dictionary than I could count. Many are able to be interpreted from the way they're used in a sentence but combined with the totally made up words, about 100+ pages could be cut from the book just by exercising the fluff Abnett likes to throw in. It's not nearly as bad as the 1st book, which had literally back to back pages and pages of just made-up locations, characters and their titles who played no role beyond simply being names & titles. I won't say these books are his \"best\" work (I'm reserving judgement until all 3 are released and read), it's definitely his *grandest*. You can tell he put so much love and care into crafting these novels, which makes sense as these are the penultimate Horus Heresy storylines, and the fact that he wrote the first book some 2 decades ago that kicked this all off. Maybe a bit *too much* love and care, but if that's a fault...I'm also not sure how I feel about the liberal use of borrowed phrases from famous literary pieces with no reference to their origin. It feels... dishonest. \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" a line by T.S. Eliot for example, is used with zero reference to where it came from. Just tossed in as a line Khorne uses to taunt Dorn. This \"borrowing\" has been done throughout the Horus Heresy novels so you could give it a pass but I've never liked when they do this. Almost every novel (that I've read) contains lines like these. At other times, certain lines come across like when a movie character says the name of the movie. A character in the book says \"the grim darkness of the far future\" which is the well known tag line for 40k. A bit too tongue in cheek for the absolutely horrible events unfolding in this book and it just immediately makes me think of that Family Guy episode where they point and laugh at this trope. These moments are jarring and only serve to take me out of the story when I come across them.The good thing about this book is it's much more pared down than the 1st book. Gone are the truly massive amounts of filler. It's still a long book (650+ pages) but it reads VERY fast. With each chapter averaging 3 or 4 pages long, you really fly through it. Abnett has also cut down on the fluff words, creating a more direct and precise read, despite the mind-jarring twisting and dislocation every character experiences. If the 1st book sets up the premise and layout for every character, then this book is the streamlined version, stepping on the gas. Looking forward to the 3rd and final book to come out so we can really take them all in as one story. The end is truly really here, with the greatest story of the 40k universe only one book away from reaching its conclusion (Don't fret! There's still \"The Scouring\" plotlines to explore afterwards and A LOT happens during that. The Fallen, the 2nd Founding and the Codex Astartes, what happened to all of the remaining loyalist Primachs, the traitor forces fleeing into the Eye of Terror/the Maelstrom... tales of revenge, violence and loss so epic as they sweep out across the entire galaxy! It's when 40k *really* becomes \"modern\" 40k).",

        "reviewDescription": "I had a great time reading this. I was waiting for it to be released with high anticipation. The stories inside these pages are woven masterfully. There is enough atmosphere and detail that you can imagine yourself right there, at the end of all things. A lot is revealed in this one, and there is a lot of sadness. The siege is almost over, the enemy has breached the walls and the defenders are fighting for their lives as enemies come from all sides. I'm trying to stay vague, as I don't want to spoil the book, but this one is a great read. Everything is coming to a head and everyone has lost control. No one is sure how or when it happened, but any semblance of military order is gone on both sides. Men brawl by firelight with hooks and clubs, but they can't remember even what they are fighting for anymore. A fifth great power of chaos is ready to be born, and its birth scream will be the end and the death of the human race.",

Actual storylines are getting a bit weak while new alien species are appearing fairly rapidly without real resolution.Humor remains fairly constant, though its beginning to get repetitive. Better to broaden the story and to produce a few conclusions  during this 5 year mission \"to boldly go where no man has gone before\".",

    "bookDescription": "Benjamin, Mark, and Chloe were all set to graduate college in a few weeks.Ben had ordered a strange object from eBay to use as cover art for a book he was writing.It looked really cool, like a slightly charred old military artifact from 70 years ago. It was possibly part of an engine. After cleaning it up (it was found in a cow field), he placed the strange device on his dorm room desk directly over the wireless charging port. That woke it up.Unknown to him, the disabled starship hiding on the moon could now communicate with the missing part. The ship needed two things:1) The missing part.2) A crew to pass itself off as a manned ship (AIs were not supposed to control ships autonomously).Now, after finishing college, they need to find a way to get the ship to land somewhere safe, supply it, and return the missing component, the artifact.They suspect the most challenging part will be getting into space. They soon find that the real problem is what awaits them when they reach the alien trading center.",

        "reviewDescription": "As I right this I am into the seventh installment of this series.The writing is humorous and quirky, increasingly so as we move along.Somewhat analogous to the writing style of Piers Anthony it word-play  --  and John Ringo in referencing other stories, memes, and plot elements as references and inside jokes.The internal/external references to a plethora of cultural touch-stones and Sci-Fi cross referencing...( a practice that has become increasingly obligatory across the genre... )...is rather well done...... but is POORLY DELIVERED...... by the *narrator* that is an inescapable character-like presence which overlays the entire story arc.Initially the \"read with Virtual Voice\" works well but as the plotting and character development increases in complexity the listener becomes increasingly aware that the narration is digitally disconnected from the written narrative as 'timing' and 'intonation' errors compound, as errors in nuance and pronunciation accrue.We will all have noticed that some books have weird editing errors that are frequent stumbling blocks or transcription and copy/paste errors that no one has proof-read-out before publishing.Here we see what happens when there is no sequence of *Producer* supervising a *Narrator* who has consulted with an *Author* as to the performance of an Audible Book ( here I am thinking of the minor pronunciation mis-steps in the Honor Harrington series from David Webber ).If the listener is a frequent customer to Audible Editions one will have noticed that actual living human narration comes with it's own variations in delivery and regional or educational pronunciation errors...What this means is that the *listener* to an Audible Edition is going to have to mentally re-process the efforts of the 'narrator' into something comprehensible...This works out -- a lot -- to be like having to pause and explain -- the 'joke' -- that is woven into the dialog of a story to a youthful partner with enormously less cultural experience.Think of reading classical literature to a small child and pausing at every other sentence to explain -- except it is the listener who must stop and work out for himself what was intended by the author of the text as twisted by Virtual Voice.Pausing to work out what was intended by the Author as the delivery is -- bungled by the *Virtual Voice* -- is almost nothing in the first book -- but by the forth book is distracting -- and now in the seventh book is ANNOYING!What is needed is to have this VV-Rendering -- re-worked -- with improved technology.If I am going to pay a Premium Price for Audible Books I expect to get a premium listening experience -- here I refer to the narration of Will Wheaton as Narrator in several productions. One is well advised to ACTIVELY SEARCH FOR THESE.",

The core relationship seems healthy and straightforward.  The characters are practical and low drama.  The wider galaxy and its denizens have a lot of promise.I withheld a star because the writing could be more immersive.

        "reviewDescription": "Lost Civilization – An Old Man’s Comeback StoryBy John WalkerGive these Characters a Rest….Just finished reading John Walkers Third Volume in his Old Mans Comeback series, Lost Civilization. Read this volume in less than 2 days. To say I was riveted to this book would be an understatement. Just as in the first two volumes, Skip and Sorsha can’t catch a break. They are continually fighting to save themselves and others and never seem to get a minute to rest and recover. So, saying this book is action packed should be obvious. As they battle their way across multiple galaxies, they continue to forge alliances and grow closer while staying focused on their mission to save the Kultarin civilization from a deadly pandemic. Character development in this series is excellent and the author continues to build on current characters as he adds new characters which are interesting in their own right. I will say that the editing is not flawless as I read through numerous errors but it did not detract from the story in the least. Can’t wait until the next volume is published to savior the continued exploits of these two intrepid rescuers.",

With the solar defences overcome through the devastating strength of the Traitor armada and the power of the warp, Horus launches his assault on the Throneworld in earnest. After withstanding a ferocious barrage of ordnance, an immense ground war commences outside the Palace with every inch gained paid for in the lives of billions. The front lines are beyond horrific and the very air is reduced to poison and blood. Bodies are thrown into the meatgrinder but the outer redoubts cannot possibly hold for long, even with the loyal primarchs to reinforce them. For Horus has his own generals to call upon... Between the plague weapons of Mortarion and the fury of Angron, the defenders face a losing battle.",

        "reviewTitle": "This books shows the epic drama of Warhammer from an interesting perspective: the scared Soldier",
        "reviewDescription": "It's my belief to write on certain subjects in Warhammer 40K, you must be one of the golden children. They won't simply select a little-known author or relative nobody; like the Primarch series, the Black Library bends its most talented wordsmiths to the task and expects the very best in results.This book is a prime example of that. Every situation, every encounter, every plotline brings you to the room almost as if you were living these times of crisis. You feel the sadness of Sanguinus, the hatred of Mortarion, the fear of Imperial citizens, the foolishness of the lost and the damned; you whoop for joy when the Khan rides, rememer your own fond moments when Sanguinus appears and feel the sadness of potential destroyed when Horus is on the page.The books shows a hideous, awful side of war that so many Warhammer books touch upon but so few bring to life; the misery of the Imperial citizen caught in a battle of titans. Here, though, it's worse; this is betrayal as it happens, the realization that not even the very best of us can resist temptation and ego.Another reviewer - Kid Kyoto - whines and sniffles about the pace of the book. I promise that you will not be bored; in fact, each subplot strengthens the story and keeps you in suspense as each grand plan of attacker and defender comes to light.This book is hard to put down, and it will be one you will not regret reading.",

        "reviewDescription": "This book was solid like the \"Solar War\". It details the bombardment from Horus' fleet as well as the first traitor landings on Terra's soil. The emphasis is placed on the conscripts which is good as we get to see how they are forced to defend their homes from unimaginable horrors. However, there were some aspects of the book that brought down the narrative.Spoilers below for the book.First with the negatives:Black Library editors somehow missed the fact that Dorn met with Vulcan near the end of Nick Kyme's \"Old Earth\" novel when the latter arrived on Terra. Somehow, this was retconned out of existence and Dorn is surprised along with his other brother primarchs when Malcador reveals Vulcan is alive during the war council meeting at the beginning of the story. I could not help but roll my eyes.I thought Perturabo's outbursts to be unbecoming for the famed Lord of Iron. Sure, the primarchs do act like children but Perturabo usually has a lot of restraint and here he comes across as a spoiled brat. However, his banter with Angron was entertaining.Myzmadra's arc was brought to a bit of a disappointing end with her whole undercover operation meant to blow a defence Bastion of the loyalists to let the traitors through. Ok...The stare down between Angron and Sanguinius near the end was a bit unnecessary because it is a tease that this particular primarch v. primarch duel will happen in future books. Except it is more entertaining when there are no teases and when the moment comes, it is sudden and a welcome surprise.Positives:Gendor Skraivok getting destroyed by Raldoron was one of the most satisfying things I have seen in the entire Horus Heresy series. It was pretty nasty seeing how Skraivok got possessed by the demon of the sword however.The three loyal primarchs each shine in this book despite their minimal page time with Dorn coordinating the defences, Sanguinuis providing hope for the defenders, and the Khan riding out like a boss. I especially liked how Sanguinius saved the Khan from the Death Guard and the mutual respect forming between these two demigods.The conscript Katsuhiro was a relatable character and his arc was good even though he had a bit too much plot armour.The tragedy of the Heresy is seen very clearly with the appearances of the World Eaters and Death Guard who have by this point gone off the deep end in their slavery to their patron gods. Even Horus himself is but a shadow of his former self which Abaddon greatly dislikes.",

    "bookDescription": "Explore a story told across the millennia that delves deep into a pair of fascinating necron characters, their relationship and their plans for the galaxy.Before the being called the Emperor revealed Himself, before the rise of the aeldari, before the necrontyr traded their flesh for immortal metal, the world was born in violence.Even when they inhabited bodies of flesh, Trazyn the Infinite and Orikan the Diviner were polar opposites. Trazyn, a collector of historical oddities, presides over a gallery full of the most dangerous artefacts – and people – of the galactic past. Orikan, a chronomancer without peer, draws zodiacs that predict and manipulate the future. But when an artefact emerges that may hold the key to the necrons’ next evolution, these two obsessives enter a multi-millennia game of cat and mouse that ends civilisations, reshapes timelines, and changes both forever. As riddles unwind and ancient secrets are revealed, the question remains: will their feud save the necron race or destroy it?",

        "reviewDescription": "Imagine if Skeletor and Cobra Commander were bitter rivals, and they spent their entire lives messing with each other and stealing the other's favorite toy.  Also, neither can die, and their petty rivalry endures for eons.  That is this book, and it is hilarious!Now I'm relatively new to 40k, having binged various lore videos over the course of 2 months, including \"If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device\", and having a solid knowledge of basic 40k factions definitely helped me get into this book better as it's probably not a good book to come in blind as a new 40k fan (this is my 4th novel).  However, I definitely wasn't prepared for a comedy, as I wasn't aware that the Necron were somewhat recently given a personality overhaul.If you don't know, the Necron started as super serious Terminator skeletons with an Egyptian hat, as depicted in the Mechanicus game, but now they're more like Saturday morning cartoon villains, while still being a viable military threat...if they can get over their own political in-fighting and petty feuds, that is.  And this book is SUCH a fun look into Necron politics and culture and shows exactly how petty they can be, and what kind of collateral damage that pettiness can cause as Trazyn and Orikan carry on their ancient grudge.However, it's not all comedy as there are some touching surprises with character development that make this a deeper story and not just a silly tale of goofball shenanigans.  Without spoiling anything, I'll just say \"the Librarian scene\" is particularly touching, and shows that not all Necron are heartless machines that just want to destroy everything.  That was the most pleasant surprise in the book.I think the only problem I had with this book was its epilogue, and I agree with the Adeptus Ridiculous podcast that it may have been ordered by Games Workshop as a tacked-on ending that very much spits in the face of much of the character development that occurs in the book and feels like complete tonal whiplash IMMEDIATELY following the final chapter before the epilogue.  It just felt like an artificial ending that maybe would have worked if the book was 100% comedy from beginning to end, but that's not how the tone of the book flows, so the epilogue just felt jarring.However, I cannot bring myself to deduct the score.  I feel like I want to nitpick this down to 4 stars, but I can't.  Even the frequent use of filter words pulling me out of the action isn't enough to bring it down to 4 stars, because that's a petty reason, and Trazyn has taught me what happens when you get too petty.  I just had SO much fun with this book and the end of Act 3 left such a lasting impression on me that this is currently my favorite 40k book and I see why it is so beloved!  It's memorable, it's informative, it's hilarious, and of course, it's quotable:\"Well, the reviews were very good\"",

        "reviewDescription": "I enjoy the 40k fictional universe a lot. It’s fun and easy reading for a guy like me who loves sci fi. So, that said, this was my first foray into the life of the Necrons that wasn’t presenting them as robotic, half-aware things. It was tough to picture a Necron smiling or smirking, but I got there.Trazyn and Orikan are an interesting pair of rivals. Their arguments, insults, and occasional begrudging efforts to work together are definitely entertaining to read.There’s a “long view” of the galaxy from the necron’s perspective that is neat to consider. This, to me, is especially so since it’s through the eyes of these Necron lords who spend 80 plus years pondering something in the way a human might spend 5 minutes pondering it. Ah, immortality.Overall, I hit this with a 5. Maybe a 4.5 if I could. I enjoyed it and I think I’d read more books that involved Trazyn and/or Orikan. The ending of the book seems to leave that as an option should the author decide to have another go.",

    "bookDescription": "What would you do if you were given a second chance?Titus Briggs is an Earth Defense soldier, a grunt, a decorated war hero—it's all he's ever known. So when a career-ending injury leaves him lying in a hospital bed, missing both legs, he struggles to accept his new reality. He can no longer walk, which means he can no longer fight.That is, until a mysterious colonel arrives and offers Titus the opportunity to step into a new kind of war, a new kind of fight.To become a new kind of soldier.Mobile Combat Suits—MOCOMS—represent the next stage in human warfare. They enable soldiers to fight like never before. Stronger. Faster. Bristling with weaponry. Far more lethal.And even a broken veteran like Titus can operate one… if he can find the heart, grit, and determination needed to pass selection.Now, with the end of humanity upon him, Titus must become the Able-Bodied Soldier.",

        "reviewDescription": "I have found that any book with writers Chaney and Anspach is one to read. 'Able Bodied Soldier' is one of those. War, no matter where it's fought, leaves a permanent emotional and, in many cases, permanent physical scars.I have seen how technological advances have given a few the ability to return to a somewhat normal life. A wonderful organization called the 'Wounded Warrior Project'* is a non-profit tax deductible group that is instrumental in helping those men and women who gave all they could in the real world.In this book, 'Able Bodied Soldier', the reader can feel some of the emotional pain when the main character, Titus Briggs, experiences what he fears will be the end of his life as a soldier. Since he was pulled from high school, Briggs has been in the forefront fighting the invading aliens. He is now a military leader in the thick of battling hostiles for the security of the planet. Former Beatle John Lennon wrote in one of his famous songs, 'Beautiful Boy', - \"Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans...\". Today, for Titus Briggs, life happens.This is a great military style story that brings all of the tension you'd expect. Couple the excellent writing with the narration by one of the very best in the business, R.C. Bray, and for me, the perfect book. - Mr.Bill*woundedwarriorproject.org",

I will follow this series.My only quibbles are the periodic grammar mistakes that are like potholes and break your train of thought. Words like \"none\" and \"every\" (and a couple dozen others) are SINGULAR no matter how many plural clauses you hang on them. A sentence like \"None of the soldiers were wearing their helmet\" is flat wrong. None WAS wearing HIS helmet (unless they had one common helmet they took turns wearing). When the gender is unknown or mixed, classic grammar specifies the masculine. If that is too un-PC for you, you have to use the cumbersome \"his or her\" or reword the sentence to something like \"None of the soldiers wore a helmet.\"Nevertheless, I'm eager for Book 2.",

        "reviewDescription": "I had previously read something by Chaney, something scifi, so I keep seeing his books in my recommendations.What I had a problem with is that this book is a little scifi and a whole lot of war. Now, I am a senior citizen, so it takes something to make me squeamish. This book is violent, but not gory. But it is full of military jargon and abbreviations. But many were undefined. So many  it knocked down from 5 ⭐'s to 3. Now I tried using the Internet to search for these definitions, but often the results were either non military or not found. Take AA for example. In a general context it is usually an abbreviation for Alcoholics Anonymous. In the context here, I figured it was something to do with aviation and/or armaments. 🤔 The point being a reader shouldn't have to stop reading to try to figure these things out!I also have a general pet peeve regarding the books I read - or two. First, is typos. Because any published book should have a professional editor to find these errors (and we all make them). Second is grammar. Actually, this is my biggest pet peeve. I grew up reading books. Not just any books, but the classics. Several by Charles Dickens, others like Black Beauty, and so many more; too many to mention. Reading taught me more about grammar than I ever was taught in school. Correct grammar just \"sounds\" right to me because I was exposed to it in a fundamental way. It wasn't so much about learning rules, as learning it intuitively through reading. So when I read \"I and my friends,\" for example, it's like fingernails on a chalkboard. I can occasionally overlook it if it's appropriate for the speaker, but it's still grating. I will say, that there are fewer grammatical errors with Chaney than some others I have read.In conclusion to my review and rant, if an author is writing about a specialized topic, it is absolutely necessary to define and explain to the reader who is not an expert in that arena. But this really is a good book, and I plan to read the sequel.",

Now they must fight to keep their newfound freedom.The Republic Senate will never tolerate rebellion. An invasion fleet is gathering—vast enough to crush every secessionist world. But to reach the Rim, it must stretch out its supply lines across the stars. This weakness is the rebels’ only hope.Captain Caleb Hawthorne and a handful of warships stand against the Republic Navy’s might. Outnumbered and outgunned, they must strike fast and strike hard, or face annihilation when the fleet reaches their homes.Meanwhile, deep in the Core, Rebecca Guzman risks everything to uncover the Republic’s darkest secrets. What she finds could alter the course of the war—and shake the Republic to its very heart.Fires of Freedom is the explosive second novel of the Secession War series, where the rebellion burns brighter—and the cost of liberty grows ever higher.",

Caleb I can understand reading his actions & achievements how he becomes a Vice Admiral I have an issue with younger brother Zack's rank increases. I'm left with many questions about his rapid rank advancement. The author should provide context or explanation for how a private swiftly progresses to a major, bypassing intermediate ranks without detailing the circumstances or achievements that would justify such an accelerated promotion. Looking forward to the next book hopefully it will answer this & other questions I have.",

    "bookDescription": "Jack Campbell’s New York Times bestselling The Lost Fleet sci-fi adventure series has transported legions of fans out of this world and into the heat of battle. Now, listeners will discover how it all began—not only for John “Black Jack” Geary and his descendant Commander Michael Geary, but for those who fought and sacrificed so much alongside them.\nSpanning from before the Alliance/Syndicate war to the devastating initial conflagration that would lead to decades of unremitting conflict and beyond into full-blown war, from the Geary’s own epic heroics to where their surviving compatriots found their own fates, this volume reveals the triumphs, tragedies, and life-altering events that made these warriors living legends in their universe.\nPacked with high-stakes military action and drama as well as humor and humanity, this volume explores the foundations of The Lost Fleet series as well as past exploits of its most popular characters—and also includes the novelization of the Lost Fleet graphic novel Corsair, which was praised as “a Tom Clancy thriller in space” (Publishers Weekly).",

I have read the Lost Fleet series, the Lost Stars Series and  all the other related books at least 5 times each, and still find new and wondrous nuances in the stories and characters. Campbell is a master craftsman in the ilk of Bradbury, Heinlein and Asimov. I find it difficult to put his books down, wanting to see the fates of those characters I have come to love and identify with. Rendezvous with Corsair continues that tradition of excellence and establishes significant back stories for many of his characters. As a retired sailor, all I can say is BZ.",

It is the end and the death. After seven brutal years of civil war, the Warmaster stands on the verge of victory. Horus Lupercal, once beloved son, has come to murder his father. The Emperor, a shining beacon of hope to many, an unscrupulous tyrant to others, must die. The lives of uncountable numbers have been extinguished and even primarchs, once thought immortal, have been laid low. The Emperor’s dream lies in tatters, but there remains a sliver of hope. Now, at the final hour of the final day, the Emperor rises. With him come his Angel, his Praetorian, and his Captain, all determined to enact terrible vengeance. Yet the hope is slim, for the Warmaster sees all and knows all, and the ultimate victory of Chaos is at hand.  There is no way out.",

        "reviewDescription": "Amazon is my least favourite fulfilment group for 40k books, having several times delivered hardbounds damaged with little more than the corporate equivalent of an \"oopsie\". That out of the way, Dan Abnett's writing is so superlative, sublime, majestic, complex and mind blowingly glorious that I'll give a 5 stars and not care about the torn jacket. This finale is years of reading and emotional investment that is a crescendo of human culture and enlightenment. War and humanity rendered into glory and tragedy, beautiful and horror. An examination of the human condition, and the angels and daemons within us, set upon the backdrop of the Siege of Terra and our species's fictionalised near extinction. The pinnacle of fantasy and science fiction written with a love of the written word, of all human endeavour and folly, reaching the heights of Shakespeare and the absurdity of Kafka, composed with the melancholy of Poe and the ability to compose thousands of years of humanity into moments like Herbert. I couldn't put it down, I was so...absorbed that I finished it in a single sitting, and I like to enjoy my books over at least a few days. And it stayed with me, profoundly, changing my mind, my heart and soul. It cements Dan Abnett not merely as the best 40k writer, but one of the greatest writers of all time. And there's a part II, imagine that, there is a part II!",

The wider story is told in little chunks. while we get the main focus with details.We get inside Malcador's mind. We even get point of view from him on the Golden Throne.  And, yes, he is the Hero of this.The decision to attack the Vengeful Spirt is laid out.  And who isn't going.  And Malcador thoughts of the replies are just great.The war is revealed for what it is, a huge ritual sacrifice.There are so many call backs, that I'm sure that I missed most of them.Page 659 - HUGE SPOILER!Still here?LOKEN IS GOING HOME!",

        "reviewTitle": "It meets the challenge of the most pivotal moment in the 40k universe",
        "reviewDescription": "We've known the story of the final confrontation of the Emperor and Horus for decades. But always it has been described in relatively dry terms and at a very high level - like a history text.The Games Workshop authors have been toiling for years now telling the story of the Heresy from every angle and in great detail. In doing so they have introduced us to many many new characters readers have come to care about through those many novels and short stories. They have given the Heresy the grandeur missing from all the prior descriptions of the conflict.But it has all, and always, been to lead us inexorably to this point. The final battle. A battle whose end we already know, and which will give birth to the entire larger 40k universe we have been reading about and playing in for almost 40 years.I would not want to have to write this story. To try to do justice to the enormous wind-up that got us here. So did Abnett pull it off?Yup. At least through the first half.The structure of the book takes us essentially from the sealing of Eternity Gate by Sanguinius to the boarding of the Vengeful Spirit and the initial encounters there. It is told in vignettes that alternate between main characters moving the timeline of the book forward, and vignettes documenting - very up close and personal - scenes from the conflict raging in and around the palace. I think this structure does a good job conveying the scale of the conflict as it winds to its final conclusion. It keeps us from forgetting that while the main fight is going to be between the Emperor and Horus, millions of others are fighting and dying at the same time.Is it long? Yes. But did you want it to be short? Could this have been told in a shorter format? Sure, but that's already been done. And if the \"fluff\" (as some describe it) had been left out, I think the book would have failed to convey the scale of it all. This is the pivotal moment in the entire 40k universe. I think it's appropriate to take the time to do service to that. And to do service to all the \"minor\" characters that have fought through however many thousands of pages of novels to get to this point. I think they earned it.And I think Abnett was absolutely the right author to tell this final story of the Heresy. GW has lots of great authors writing lots of great novels and short stories for it. But the guy who gave us Eisenhorn, Ravenor and Gaunt's Ghosts has to occupy a special place.",

        "reviewDescription": "I love Dan Abnett and was really looking forward for this book. It is hard to believe that the Horus Heresy saga is almost over, and he is probably the best author to narrate its very end. Overall, he did a great job with this monumental task, although there are small issue. The story has lots of characters, subplot and mysteries, that has to be resolved, and this takes a certain amount of space. Most of the subplots are interesting, but a few of them takes longer than needed IMHO, resulting sometimes in an unpleasant break of the flow of the narration. But this is a little thing on, otherwise, a fantastic book. The story is an emotional rollercoaster, where you finally see the perspective of the biggest players at all, Horus and Big E. And it is full of truly emotional moments, especially because you know that, for some of your favourite characters, this might be (or will be) the end of the road.Final consideration: I started reading this book on Kindle, but then got the whispersync audiobook from audible (with a discount). I highly recommend listening the audiobook, because the voice acting is top notch and brings the story to a whole new level.",

        "reviewDescription": "\"The clocks run out.\"From a writer's perspective, the Siege of Terra and especially the end must be a dream and a nightmare, both due to fan expectations and literary issues: several plots need an end; the scale, the heroism and the horror need to be represented without lapsing into boring hyperbole or tediousness etc. And guess what, Abnett is on top of it.More than in other books, he uses different literary devices: several perspectives, close in and personal, further out and strategic; first person and third person; all interspersed with little vignettes of devastation. We also learn quite a lot about the Emperor (some of whose recurrent interventions in history are confirmed) and other protagonists, but not too much (if I'm not mistaken, there is even a hint or two towards some of Abnett's other works, eh, \"Orphaeus\"?)When I use the term \"epic\" in the title, I do mean it in the original sense; I quote Harmon and Holman on the characterisation of the epic: \"A long narrative poem in elevated style presenting characters of high position in adventures forming an organic whole through their relation to a central heroic figure and through their development of episodes important to the history of a nation or race\" - so yes, it is fairly wordy (unlike, say, the terse prose of \"The Vincula Insurgency\").The Siege of Terra is mind-numbing, even for 40K - \"The End and the Death Vol I\" keeps it going a little longer, it might even turn the screw that little further... Not my favourite Abnett, but hard to put down nonetheless.",

    "bookDescription": "The Bedlam Galaxy lies at the heart of the Laniakea Supercluster and is a focal point for all of the wormhole transits spanning that great expanse. Among the many races drawn to and inhabiting its 10,000+ stars, humanity is one of the most recent and longest anticipated additions. Once nearly driven to the brink of extinction by violent and irreconcilable gender divides within the dominant cultures of their homeworld, new technologies emerged to save the species from their own folly and helped propel them into a new age of interstellar exploration. Inevitably, that drive into the stars led to the discovery of their own wormhole transit at the edge of the solar system, and from there they ran straight into the waiting arms of Bedlam's great multi-species intergalactic trade and defense alliance, known colloquially as the Alliant.Having been coerced to board the all female maximum-security galactic prison ship known as the Sheol in order to perform one vital repair, Vahkis Greye has so far managed to survive dozens of potentially lethal incidents. He has faced constant attempts on his life by marauding aliens, homicidal inmates, out-of-control robots, and even his own government. And if that wasn't enough, the ship itself is coming down around him. Singularity core failures, multiple hull breaches, an overloaded computer core, a mysteriously absent ship's AI, and rapidly dwindling supplies are just a few of the legion of threats that could have potentially snuffed out all life onboard the ship.So clearly, it's been a rough couple of days.But Greye is also no longer alone. Phyra Astarte, the lone surviving shock trooper of the ashtor fleet that attacked the Sheol now stands at his side, lending him her considerable strength as well as her optimism for the future. The mad Alexandra twins work day and night in their medical lab to ostensibly aid him in his efforts, though they clearly have machinations of their own in the works. Reverie Pixi, a thief and burglar of the notoriously soft-fingered and fox-like skipp race, who has the genetic ability to bend and manipulate light around her body, and of course, the ever-distracting Lilia Namaah, eishethi leader of the largest remaining gang on the ship. They, along with a genetically modified Alliant pilot and a nameless trace girl found within a hellish unmarked cell in the bowels of the ship, have joined him in his fight to survive all that the galaxy has to throw at them.But perhaps the most direct threat of all has been lurking within the armored walls of the Sheol since the very first shot was fired and now, with the ship's most vital functions all but secured, it has begun to move against them. Pursued from within and without, Greye and his companions must find a way to solidify their control over the Sheol, or the end that awaits them will truly be the stuff of nightmares.",

        "reviewDescription": "I just finished book two and wow!  Well thought out, exciting & spicy space based science fiction. The story may have been a little slow to develop in book one, (Bedlam), but it’s an exciting ride after that. Stick with it because it’s where context is developed. The author does such a good job of making alien races real and making the reader feel like you can picture what’s going on. I marvel at that when a writer can work that magic. The author weaves in love, compassion, empathy and graphic sex and sexual themes that are steamy but fit in with the story and doesn’t let them take over the big picture. On the other side of the spectrum is cruelty and violence salted in that sadly is not so hard to imagine in a high tech universe. However, the ragtag mix of good guys win in the end after edge of seat battles and struggles and live to continue the adventure. If this checks some boxes for you I hope you enjoy it as much as me. I’m eager to see what comes next!",

There is lots of twists and turns, with some dark themes. I enjoyed the hard sci-fi references and battles. There are even some spicy scenes as well. I also found some of the different alien races interesting. For me this was a quick read as I arrived at the end before I knew it. The ending of the book has me hooked for more and I hope it comes out soon, as I understand it, this book took 6 months to write. I guess I'll have to be patient.

        "reviewDescription": "I really enjoyed the first book in the series and couldn't wait for this second one to come out - and it definitely didn't disappoint. The adventure continues where the first book left off and brings even more danger and complexity into the life of the MC and the other characters, which makes for such an engaging read that's hard to put down. We get an even deeper understanding of the characters as they deal with the new threats and their relationships further evolve. And of course with that occasional fun and witty sense of humor sprinkled throughout. The author once again did an outstanding job and I eagerly await the third book!!",

        "reviewDescription": "I don't normally enjoy reading sci-fi much as it's hard for my brain to put the technology into an appreciable context, but this series finally did it. I had an immense amount of interest in the world building and technology because of how well it tied everything together. I think how well written the main character was and the interactions with the twins is what really sealed the deal. If you're like me and struggle to enjoy sci-fi for similar reasons but WANT to, give this series a try.Fair warning, as the author also mentions this in the beginning: Parts of the story are a little dark. When it comes to the genre I think it's kind of mandatory so glad it's here, but it's well balanced by all the wholesome elements and optimistic direction the story is slowly tilting towards. Don't get me wrong, the pace is fast but the direction it's moving is changing ever so slightly, I feel, and it really makes me impatient for the next book.",

As some was only given to us briefly and need a brief log or data section for.All in all though I can't wait for the next installment and believe this had the capacity for a fantastic universe with many iterations to come.",

Character development is quite good, and the author leaves many avenues to make this a long-term/multi-book effort, with a potential to add entirely new story lines in the same universe.When reading this type of saga, I often pay attention to how realistic (or entirely ridiculous) the physics of it all might be.  That wasn't a problem here, as the story doesn't go crazy trying to explain everything, and a few things can just be taken at face value without any of the \"oh, come on\" moments common to the genre.  I will say the timeline can be a bit awkward, as some things seem to be set just a short time in the future, while others seem millennia away.I eagerly await the next installment.",

As Van soon discovers, the Fade never lose.But they’ve never met Van and his crew.Experience the fifth entry in the best selling science fiction series of 2021 from USA Today Bestselling Authors J.N.

Love the toying with humorous AI concept and organic vs artificial sentience. Brilliant!!! More!!! Van and his crew are just the team and family you’d love to join. Preferably not as an identity chip though. 😁👍👍👏👏👏✌️❤️ Taken the concept of Star Trek’s Data with an emotion chip to entirely new levels!!! Bravo!!! 5 star reviews all the way!!!",

        "reviewDescription": "I love the novel, at times it had me rolling on the floor.  Mr Alanso has come up with outstanding recipe blending drama and comedy into one story.  This is sequel to first book which I also found outstanding and was very glad I read.I recommend you get the first book so as not to find yourself in the middle of the story. I recommend you read the first book before reading this one. But, I will give a brief synopsis from the first book to now.  A US soldier returns home from serving overseas living with his parents on a farm.  One day aliens land on earth and attack earth’s industrial and power grid.  Our soldier is able to capture one of the aliens from the invasion.  Invaders are repulse by second set of aliens and earth is so grateful they commit troops to the war being fought.  Troops are deployed to another star system being fought over and our soldier goes thru several ups and down while being deployed.  Toward the end of the book he finds and ancient artifact from highly evolve civilization that ascended.  This artifact turns out to be an AI (artificial Intelligence) with an attitude to insult anything and every one.  This is where the fun begins and thus leads to the second book and very hopeful 3rd book.In this sequel the soldier embarks on a mission to help the AI find ‘THE NETWORK’ or other AI that might still exist.  The AI is hampered with some loss of memory and also absent minded.  In their travels to find the Network they start finding disturbing occurrences in some of solar systems they visit.  Someone or something has been tampering with planets orbits or destroying ancient outpost were the only know people to have this power were the ancients.",

        "reviewDescription": "The titular \"Expeditionary Force\" is no longer the focus of the series, though the next book promises to return to it.  Instead, as was evident in the second half of the first book, this series is about humanity's effort to stay safe from the interstellar war among more advanced species; it is about the quest of the uber-AI Skippy to find something called the Collective; and it is about the relationship between Skippy and Col. Joe and how that plays out in the first two themes.  In truth, it often seems that the second book is more about the third than the first two \"big\" themes, and how the reader reacts to that will largely determine one's relative enjoyment of the book.AT heart it's a buddy story, in which the human is a bit like B.V. Larson's Blake, someone who uses his innate wit to defeat his more capable alien adversaries, and the AI is literally a deus ex machina.  There is a great deal of banter between Joe and Skippy, probably too much, but I chose to see Skippy as Pinocchio-like -- terribly anxious to become a \"real\" person and thus too eager to demonstrate his grasp of the vernacular.  Skippy has all the tools:  every language, vast data and processing power, and a pretty amazing ability to remotely hack others.  What he lacks is, for want of a better word, common sense.The quest puts the crew of the Flying Dutchman into one scrape after another, and the final one is a real doozy.  But their survival and the continuation of their journey is never in doubt -- it's series, for goodness sake -- so one simply needs to enjoy the \"how\" instead of the \"whether\".  This is not a taxing series to read, it is .",

Then other times, out of no where, he punches me with a new emotion I wasn't ready for. There is also so many fun battles, and I do mean fun. These are not normal battles if Joe and Skippy are involved. I can't describe just how exciting these books are. Fun, creative, strange creatures, hilarious, tender, great science, adventure, wonderful and witty dialogue, crazy capers, a Majestic AI named Skippy, a crew that is incredible and adaptable, and many close calls.

        "reviewDescription": "While the author did an okay job of creating a story, characters and dialogue, there was very little action and the story tended to plod along.  One example is that the author puts together a credible team of the most bad ass SpecOps team on (or off) Earth, hence the name of the book, right? He spends considerable time developing that; going into the team's training, talents and personalities.  Are they ever used?  Do they ever fight?Aside from one short low key encounter, no.  The entire namesake of the book has almost nothing to do with the actual story.There were also typos galore, some of them bad enough to make you stop, reread the sentence, figure out what the author was trying to say and read in the correct words.  That becomes a jarring process, taking you out of the story and sometimes making it a pain to read.  The one bright spot in the book was the AI character named Skippy.  His smart ass dialogue was fun and amusing, though at times even that got a little old.  If you are looking for an action packed shoot-em up story, this ISN'T the book for you.",

        "reviewDescription": "Si l'histoire est intéressante, si le ton du récit est toujours amusant, ce second tome souffre des mêmes gros défauts que le premier, l'originalité du propos en moins.L'auteur  privilégie systématiquement les dialogues, les monologues, les résumés. Du coup, sur les 500 pages du livre, on se retrouve avec pas loin de 200 pages de bavardages inutiles, d'exposés techniques ennuyeux, de dialogues répétitifs entre Joe et Skippy et parfois de résumé des chapitres précédents. À force de répétitions, Skippy devient horripilant au fil des pages, par surexploitation de son espièglerie.Les situations sont également très répétitives : à chaque problème insoluble, une solution géniale et innovante est trouvée, souvent par Joe, au grand désarroi de Skippy.Les scènes les plus importantes, les affrontements, les combats, sont le plus souvent escamotées avec un petit résumé, ce qui est assez sidérant dans un livre aussi bavard.Tous les autres personnages du romans sont des ectoplasmes, tant l'auteur est rivé sur la relation Joe / Skippy.SpecsOps aurait pu être un excellent roman de 300 pages. C'est un roman pénible de 500 pages. J'ai envie de connaître la suite de l'histoire, les mystères de cet univers, mais malgré toute la bonne volonté du monde, je ne m'infligerai pas les 3000 pages qui suivent. L'auteur à de l'humour, des idées, mais sa technique narrative est pauvre et son oeuvre manque cruellement du travail d'un éditeur compétent.",

His new rank means only that he has the authority to negotiate with the Syndics, who have suffered tremendous losses and may finally be willing to end the war. With grim determination, Geary leads the fleet back out into Syndic space.\nThis seasoned commander knows surrender never comes easy. But even as he steels himself to confront the immediate enemy, he is all too aware that a greater alien threat lurks on the far side of Syndic-occupied space.",

        "reviewTitle": "Very Satisfying Ending!",
        "reviewDescription": "I have greatly enjoyed reading this series.  And the ending was spectacular.The Lost Fleet series holds the backdrop of a hundred years space war between the Syndics and the Alliance. It's about 40% fleet movements, tactics, and engagements with the Enemy. About 20% politics are involved among ship captains, Alliance leaders, and Syndic leaders. And about 25% involve the personal lives, pain, and struggles of the main characters.  The remaining 15% is the technical parts involving space travel, weaponry, defense, intelligence gathering, ship maintenance, and time lags.I found Geary's fleet movements during battle engagements fascinating.  Trying to picture where all the ships are, which way they are headed, how fast they are going, where they will end up -- and then fitting all that into a comprehensive tactical plan -- boggles my mind. Even coming up with it well enough to write about it boggles my mind.  It is just a good thing I wasn't an admiral they were depending on for victory.For people who like this sort of space war saga I highly recommend this book and series. I read the \"Genesis Fleet\" first, which is the three book prequel series, but it isn't necessary.I put off reading any of these books, even though Jack Campbell is a favorite author, because I read a review that said that the books talked to much about Black Jack's love interests. They made it sound like the books contained a lot of sex. I don't enjoy books like that, but I found what sex there was was tastefully done (non-pornographic) and definitely part of the story line; not just added in to spice it up. The tension between Black Jack and his love interest only made the ending that much sweeter.I will probably read the next series in this universe after a break.I would rate this book PG-13, for mild language and war subjects.(A public library book read with my Kindle App.)",

        "reviewTitle": "A good conclusion to a series I enjoyed very much.",
        "reviewDescription": "This is the sixth and final book in the Lost Fleet military series, a series that I've gobbled up in under three weeks. I enjoyed the series very much, partly for its excellent space battles, and partly because I was in the mood for a hero that I could root for in an uncomplicated way. The hero of the series, John Geary, is unambiguously good and is put in a succession of difficult situations that held my attention well. The reservations that I expressed in my review of book four still hold, and I could add a couple more to the list. Indeed, part of me wants to add more, because I think many people I respect would rate this series poorly. Part of me wants to appear cleverer and more sophisticated than I am. Yes, I like many books that are more demanding and more nuanced than the Lost Fleet series. But I admit it: I like this too.About my reviews: I try to review every book I read, including those that I don't end up enjoying. The reviews are not scholarly, but just indicate my reaction as a reader, reading being my addiction. I am miserly with 5-star reviews; 4 stars means I liked a book very much; 3 stars means I liked it; 2 stars means I didn't like it (though often the 2-star books are very popular with other readers and/or are by authors whose other work I've loved).",

        "reviewDescription": "The Lost Fleet wraps up, both in print and in story, with Victorious. In short, everything is wrapped up in grand fashion. This is a great bookend for the series, and there's plenty of meat that makes this worthwhile as more than just a bookend.I'll be giving spoilers on the books up to this point, so go back to Book One and get reading if you haven't already!The setup: \"Black Jack\" Geary and crew have finally returned to Alliance space after a final and desperate fight. Things are certainly not well in Alliance space, and you just know Geary's going to have to take the fleet right back out as soon as they've duct taped it back together. Don't forget that there's an alien menace that's going to put him between a rock and a hard place, even if the fleet can finally crush the Syndics once and for all.The execution: Campbell continues to write some of the best space battles ever put to print, and now he's got some fresh ships to spice up the mix. The story takes a few genuinely interesting and unexpected turns at a few points, and there's plenty of must-read information for fans of the series. Most everything gets an explanation, down to why the Alliance names its ships after ideas instead of places as our current military does.The downside: For all the rollicking space battles, I've always had a few minor bones to pick with this series. First off is Campbell's insistence in recapping previous works, so there's again quite a bit of retreading here. He says it's because he's trying to attract new readers in each volume, and it's hard to fault him on that, but more than anything it just leaves me wondering what story development he could have spent that space on instead. The other gripe that really comes into play here, is Geary's lame love interest in Desjani. With Co-President Rione, the interest between a heroic fleet Captain and a dirty politician made for some real (and sexy) intrigue. The relationship with Desjani, by contrast, is a little too Harlequin with the characters dramatically facing away from each other and mumbling awkwardly about the feelings-which-we-dare-not-name. I'll go ahead and give you the minor spoiler that there's never any bodice-ripping, although I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing in the end.Overall, the flaws of the work mostly add up to some sappy and seen-this-before moments sandwiched between the incredible space battles, which stand as the true hallmark of the series. Buy Victorious now- and the rest of the series if you haven't already- and be prepared for one of the best little serials out there. It's not the deepest read out there, but it is a ball of space battling fun.",

One involved rescuing a couple from a liquid filled container and the female of the first rescue attacked one of the newer aliens, not knowing what was going on, during the rescue. This caused problems with the alien rescuer. Secondly, four individuals were rescued from a desolate planet that involved two clans fighting each other. Once again, the \"Ender of Wars\" showed up and outclassed all of them.  I highly recommend this book and the entire series.",

We accumulate a few more aliens to the crew, and we come home with a few artifacts which we decide to melt down without investigation into bullion.  We narrowly escape a planet being controlled by an apparently hostile AI.  We got shadowed by an unknown alien that we learn nothing about.  We come across evidence of a conflict which leaves an artifact behind, but we know nothing of the combatants or their location.  During our next trip out, we'll have lots of people whose attitude about our taking artifacts will be open to potential hostility, and that doesn't include the new people we'll run across..",

There were three main plots in the series, each one was brought to a satisfying conclusion with a good epilogue ending.

    "bookDescription": "The last humans in the solar system battle for survival—and encounter an alien AI—in this action-packed military science-fiction thriller. In the aftermath of a bioengineered plague that wiped out all life on Earth, Jupiter’s Europa colony has become the last bastion of human civilization, and it’s Lt. Ryan Braeder’s job to keep what remains of his species alive. With food and supplies dwindling, he has no choice but to take his last ships on a perilous journey to a dead colony on Ceres in a desperate bid to find provisions and replacement parts.What Braeder didn’t expect to find on the asteroid, among the barren regolith and deserted buildings, was a mutated virus and a rogue group of Russian scientists. Now, the more threads he pulls, the more he unravels a web of conspiracies, horrifying medical experiments, and a hidden threat that would see his crew marooned on the asteroid.Meanwhile, back on Europa, Braeder’s second-in-command, Rani Singh, stumbles across an alien artifact buried in the ice sheets. An extraterrestrial intelligence lurks inside, and with the colony’s power failing, Singh frantically searches for a way to communicate with the otherworldly object. However, the artifact seems to have an agenda of its own, and it’s impossible to know if it’s intentions are friendly . . . or deadly.Praise for Extinction“An interstellar yarn wrought with suspense and indelible characters.” —Kirkus Reviews“Leviathan Wakes meets Battlestar Galactica in this high-stakes story of survival on the moon of Jupiter. Heart-pounding and thrilling, Extinction follows an unlikely leader as he races to save humanity against impossible odds.” —Claire Barner, author of Moonrising“This insightful glimpse into our possible future is a must read.” —Sue Nelson Buckley, author of The Trouble with Jake and Hiding in Plain Sight“Packed with intense action, layered characters, and thought-provoking dilemmas . . . This is a story that lingers, making you ponder the fragile line between extinction and survival.” —Literary Titan",

    "bookDescription": "Deep within Syndicate World space, the Alliance fleet continues its dangerous journey home under the command of Captain John “Black Jack” Geary—revived after a century spent in suspended animation. Geary’s victories over the enemy have earned him both the respect—and the envy—of his fellow officers…\n“Black Jack” Geary has made many risky decisions as commander, but ordering the Alliance fleet back to the Lakota Star System where it had nearly been destroyed by the Syndics has his officers questioning his sanity. It’s a desperate gamble that may buy Geary just enough time to prepare for the Syndics’ inevitable return—and give the fleet a fighting chance of survival.\nBut even as he struggles to stay one step ahead of the enemy, Geary must face conspirators within his own fleet—an unknown number of officers who want a change of command. And Geary knows that his fleet must stand together or the Syndic forces will tear them apart…",

The initial work in this sequence is Dauntless.In the previous volume, the fleet entered the Lakota system with eight Syndic capital ships following them.  A small flotilla of Syndic ships was guarding the hypernet gate.  A larger force exited from the T'negu jump.  Then an even larger Syndic force came through the hypernet gate.Fleet politics was still contentious.  Media joined Casia in criticizing the fleet commander.  Later, Renown lost propulsion and Media took the Paladin to her rescue.  Both ships were destroyed by the Syndics.Geary decided to leave the system.  Three battleships stayed behind as a rear guard.  Then the lost fleet jumped back to Ixion.  On the way, Iger told him that the Syndic fleet from the hypernet had not intended to arrive at the Lakota system.In this novel, Jack Geary is the designated acting commander of the fleet survivors.  He is the most senior captain within the Alliance due to his century long stasis is an escape pod.  Unfortunately, he is also trapped within his own legend.Tanya Desjani is an Alliance Captain, commanding the battlecruiser Dauntless.  She is Geary's Flag Captain.  She works well with Geary.Victoria Rione is the Co-president of the Callas Republic and a member of the Alliance Senate.  She is the only civilian within the fleet.  She had been Geary's lover for a few weeks.Casia is an Alliance Captain, commanding the battleship Conqueror.  His ship is in the Third Battleship Division, formerly commanded by Numos.Midea is an Alliance Captain, commanding the battleship Paladin.  She had served as executive officer of the Orion under Numos before being promoted.Iger is an Alliance Lieutenant in charge of intelligence gathering in the Dauntless.  He seems very competent and his personnel have provided some excellent information.  Naturally, his intelligence usually comes well after fleet operations.Carabali is an Alliance Colonel.  She is the senior officer among the remaining Marines of the fleet.In this story, the fleet is returning to the Lakota system.  The crews are enthusiastic about the opportunity to recover their lost comrades and to attack the Syndics again.  Rione is puzzled by the crew reaction and fearful of their chances.  Geary tries to explain his reasoning and the crew reaction, but she doesn't have a clue.When the fleet exits the jump point, both Geary and Rione are on the bridge.  The jump point is still mined, but the fleet avoids the field.  Most of the Syndic ships are damaged and the hypernet gate is not guarded.  They have definitely surprised the Syndics.Desjani wants to try for the hypernet gate, but Geary is not so eager.  He hasn't yet told her about the aliens controlling destinations in the hypernet.  He reminds her of the things that they need to do before the pursuing fleet catches up with them.Their first action is aimed at the shipyards and other facilities in the system.  Along the way, they will distribute recently manufactured expendables from the auxiliaries.  Geary and Desjani divvy up planning the maneuvers.An Alliance battleship is located within a large collection of damaged Syndic ships.  Sensor readings indicate that the Syndics have patched some damaged compartments.  Geary believes that the Audacious is being used as a prison for captured Alliance personnel.Geary is concerned about the Syndics blowing the power core of the battleship.  He broadcasts a threat to destroy every Syndic ship, shuttle, and escape pod in the system if the Alliance prisoners are killed.  Then the fleet heads toward the cluster of damaged ships to liberate the POWs as well as much needed materiel.Geary orders his ships to inflict maximum damage to the Syndic naval units and facilities, but to use hell-lances as much as possible to preserve existing expendables.  He also warns them about accidentally inducing a core overload on the Audacious.The Syndic guard force breaks up as it notices the Alliance fleet, with some heading toward the hypernet gate.  Geary thinks that they will guard the gate and destroy it if necessary.  But such destruction could result in the release of energy corresponding to a nova.Two Syndic battleships turn toward the Alliance fleet.  Geary wonders what these battleships are doing.  Desjani points out that they are defending the system even if the effort is hopeless.A damaged Syndic heavy cruiser is being towed away from the jump point.  The crews abandon ship in escape pods.  Geary has his ships pick up several pods for prisoner interrogation.Casia calls Geary with a complaint about the lack of oversight on the Marines raiding the Audacious.  Geary points out that he is supervising Carabali and she is supervising the Marine teams.  Casia counters that the Marines are not being directly supervised by the ship commanders.Geary discusses the issue with Desjani and learns that such practices are common within the Alliance Navy.  Geary wonders at the degree of micromanagement.  Then he firmly quashes Casia's complaints.  Geary also calls Carabali and assures her that such oversight will not be the norm within his fleet.The fleet takes out more damaged Syndics ships.  Then they attack the two incoming battleships.  The Marines reach the Audacious and take off the POWs.  Shortly thereafter, the Syndic pursuit fleet exits from the jump point.This tale has the Alliance fleet again maneuvering against a much larger fleet.  Geary has his crews prepare a surprise for the Syndics.  He again uses the fleet auxiliaries as bait.The lost fleet enters the jump point for Anahalt.  The next installment in this sequence is Relentless.Highly recommended for Campbell fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of naval combat, service intrigue, and competent commanders.  Read and enjoy!-Arthur W. Jordin",

        "reviewDescription": "Book number four of a six book military science fiction series.  Plus several sequel series consisting of fourteen books total.  I read the well printed and well bound MMPB published by Ace in 2008 that I bought on Amazon.  I have purchased the two sequel books in this series and plan to read them soon.I did not know John G. Hemry was the real name for Jack Campbell as I purchased the Stark series quite a while back and enjoyed it also.The Alliance sent a war fleet into the Syndic home star system via the new FTL network to defeat the Syndics once and for all.  However, the Syndics knew that they were coming and destroyed many of the Alliance space warships.  Now the Alliance warships need to leave or be destroyed one by one.The Alliance admiral left Captain John “Black Jack” Geary in charge of the Alliance fleet before he and his staff were murdered by the Syndics in the negotiations.  Captain John “Black Jack” Geary was found by the Alliance fleet on their way to Syndic space, in stasis in an old emergency pod.  A hundred year old emergency pod.  Captain John “Black Jack” Geary may be a hundred years out of date but some things like tactics of war spaceship fleets never go away.Captain Geary is leading his fleet of warships and supply ships through old wormholes, trying to anticipate Syndic attacks and gather raw materials and feed his crews.  After they exit the wormhole from the Lakota star system, he turns the fleet around and goes back.  What they find surprises them greatly.",

        "reviewDescription": "Earth is at war with the Syndic. Who are human just like you and me but take an entirely different perspective on what is right and wrong. What's right is anything that financially or politically benefits them. What's wrong is everything else.What started this war that has been going on for 100 years ? No one seems to remember but the important thing is to destroy the other guy. And that's the premise for the entire series of 6 books, recently expanded to 7 although on a different story arc with the same characters in this series.Things get really sideways in this volume as Admiral Geary's decision to take the fleet back to the scene of their worst defeat, the Lukota system, has many Captains questioning what the Admiral is up to. Disobedience and contrary actions during battle are creating untenable conditions for Admiral Geary.But Admiral Geary knows it's the right decision, or is it ? It will certainly surprise the Syndic Fleet which is now spread throughout Syndic space trying to catch the Earth fleet .Admiral Geary proceeds with his plan to the advantage of Earth's fleetThis a great military science fiction series with well developed characters and space battle strategies",

Le « casting «  est suffisamment fonctionnel  néanmoins et de ce fait malgré tout  , ce tome est une pièce sympa de science-fiction militaire .Le bouquin est donc  un peu lobotomisé , mais ça passe à mon humble avis  .En toute franchise ,  je pense que l'auteur devrait écrire en duo avec une plume plus littéraire ,  un minimum en tout cas et plus que lui certainement  .L'auteur n'est pas intégralement  et lourdement Semper Fi et de ce point  sa prose n'est pas désagréable et elle est  digeste  .Sa compétence militaire qui suinte littéralement de toute ces pages , n'est pas désagréable non plus  .

With Sorcerers and Cloaks and every other kind of criminal, Van, Torina, Perry and Icky learn that friends come in all shapes and sizes—and so do enemies.From the depths of space to Iowa, join Van as he fights to save his guild, free stolen lives, and discover that money makes the universe go around—money and lies, that is.And Van will find the truth, no matter what the cost.",

The writing style and dialogue are witty without being slapstick.  I love the play on words and the humor from deliberate slight misinterpretation that the characters play off each other.  Its a great way to write personalities to show the character.  The plot is imaginative, and the protagonist is basically a good guy who is pragmatically ruthless when necessary.",

        "reviewDescription": "The storyline of finding a spaceship in grandpa's barn, along with a couple of non-rogue super-intelligent AI's who just happen to show you the road to becoming a galactic knight-errant, is less than believable. The technical stuff is, let's just say, less than believable. So why should you read this story? The answer is a good and fast-paced storyline. Adolescent dialogue aside, the story is FUN to read, and the characters are by and large fun to follow on their journey. Also, the authors seem to have had fun writing this, which adds to the reading pleasure. Nothing is worse than abored writer just having to push out a sequel before a deadline. Warning - you need to start with book 1 and go from there, and you might end up spending more time and money on this than you intend.",

        "reviewDescription": "I can’t believe I waited until finishing the third book to write a review. In all candor, it’s because as soon as I’m done I want to read the next one. I had the first book for quite some time before even started reading it. I would’ve thought it was going to be a “campy” lope of a story about humans experiencing space. There’s nothing wrong with campy I like that and it is alright,  but the sophistication and enduring qualities of the characters, are superb. (it is not a story about humans, it’s a story about space and humans are just apart, not even the central part ). The science fiction ideas and different alien cultures are so much fun with common human themes of concern. Like money, needing to have a form of barter to function. but I particularly enjoy is the extremely witty repertoire between the characters which include endearing and lovable, if not deadly AI characters. The loving disrespect in comments is qoute worthy. I read a lot of sci-fi, lots of great writers, I think a von Hefner and his great stories, Craig alanson and his comedic dialogue between characters, and these authors definitely match if not exceed it. My most exciting thing is I have 12 more books to read then on to other storylines. Thank you! (One saying which I’m sure is not original, very military which I greatly enjoyed was, \"The only thing on the battlefield that travels faster than a bullet is a rumor.\")",

Because of his politics, when Hollywood got finished with his novel, Hienlien rolled in his grave.These two gave birth to military sci-fi.  Hienlien even gave us powered armor in his version.It is great to see that authors like Channey and Anspatch are working hard to keep the genre alive, interesting, and read.Great job, guys.",

However about halfway through this book when the protagonist suffers a back injury the rest of the book is rushed and lacking a step by step detail that was present in the previous books. It reads like the story is on fast forward or your watching a show that it’s being forwarded to only the action scenes without the setup. Could have been better, I hope the fourth and fifth are back on track.",

        "reviewDescription": "The military jargon went over my head but the story was very exciting and easy to follow.  The ending seemed rushed (no further mention was ever made of the possible enemy wormhole on earth) so maybe the story's not really over.  There's no way to destroy all life on a planet without destroyng the ecosystem of the entire planet.  If they could that, why send an invasion force?  Anyway, I totally enjoyed the book.",

Please start with book one in this series and I would bet you will move through each book  with a real need to get to all of them. Good reading, my friend.",

The humour is with us from the start, seen through the self-deprecating MC, and the world building comes natural through dialogue and action (no info dumps). The book feels like the first one in a series, limning the cast who I hope we’ll meet further down the page. I feel it deals with trauma in a somewhat cursory way, solving it logically, but not emotionally. And mind you, if you like to think out the solutions in the story (like in a murder mystery), this book isn’t about that. The solutions they come up with are part of the world building so you can’t know beforehand (but the solutions are plausible and rhymes with our world, so they are easy to buy, except for one time when it felt out of character, but that might explained when I read further).That said, it’s well worth spending your time with if you want fast paced action seen through a wry perspective.",

        "reviewDescription": "This is the first book I've read by Skyler Ramirez and I'm glad I found his work.  This first book was a refreshing read, light and funny and a fun adventure.  My only con first: it's short.  Weighing in at 137 pages, the first book is over quickly after the characters and world are established.  When I realized I was a third of the way through the book and I was still getting up to speed with the beginning of the main plot, I almost put it down.  But then I saw it was a series.  And that leads into the pros: It's an interesting world with interesting characters.  Brad Mendoza is a lovable self-destructive buffoon, with a past he hasn’t come to terms with.  He’s funny and self-depreciating, and the running narrative from his jaded perspective keeps the story moving.  Jessica Lin comes off as a two dimensional Miss Perfect but I think the coming books will flesh out her character more.  She’s got a past too, that will need to come to light.  There’s just the right amount of world-building for a book this length and I can’t wait to see what the rest of the series looks like.  And I’m hoping the antagonist from the first book ends up being the villain of the series.  We’ll see.  I highly recommend this if you’re looking for a light, clean, funny space adventure.",

        "reviewDescription": "Fun quick space opera read. Light humorous reading with basic characterization with implications of going deeper in future books. There was part that implied deeper into the ugly side of life and I was just as glad the author did not dwell on that. Adventure and action in this book and I expect in the books to come. I went ahead and ordered the rest of series that has been written so far and published in paperback.  I have since read several more of the series books.  They live up to the fun quality of this first book of the series.",

        "reviewTitle": "Where’s the Sixth Star for Awesomeness!",
        "reviewDescription": "I happened upon this book somewhat by accident.  As a new author in the genre I made it a point to familiarize myself with other books like what I was writing. It checked the boxes of social proof with a high number of reviews and the blurb was intriguing. What I didn’t expect was a wildly entertaining ride through the galaxy with Brad and Jessica, all orchestrated by Maestro Ramirez!The writing is great, the action is fast paced, but best of all, the humanity of the characters is what really shines through!  Skyler Ramirez’s style is not what one typically expects in many genres nowadays: he proves that an author can write without any gratuitous language and violence, but yet keeps it real. It’s refreshing, actually.I’m writing this review as I read through the 8th of this series since I got so into them I forgot to pay it forward to highly endorse this series!  It’s not just this series too, so read everything else Skyler has written.  Don’t be like Brad and go READ!",

        "reviewDescription": "I wasn't sure about this book at first, just from the blurb and details on Amazon, I tend to avoid the smaller books and go for longer ones that have some world building. But I gave this a chance, and I was immediately hooked, very short read, there's enough depth to the characters to get a sense on things and then it takes you on a whirlwind of an adventure. The story keeps building in the next book, and the one after (just starting the 4th now).I've not been able to put them down, enjoying the story, the flow, and the characters. Very entertaining reads that aren't over the top so it ends up being relaxing to read. Would highly recommend!",

        "reviewDescription": "I've been an avid reader my entire adult life, since the 70s. In this day of self-publishing, there's a lot of bad writing out there now that in the past never would have made it to the press. A reader often has to wade through a lot of badly written slop before finding someone who can actually write well. So I'm very happy to have recently discovered Mr. Ramirez. He knows how to write and he delivers on the promise of his titles. It's light-hearted escapism, and very, very funny. And his writing skill is excellent, a pleasure to read. I will be reading the rest of the series.",

The Fafnir is no longer a mere ship—it’s a force to be reckoned with, but it isn’t complete.One possible answer lies in deep space, in a secret facility funded by an array of allies. But this laboratory creates something far more deadly than a virus or a weapon.It produces ships.Null Stellarium is more than a shipyard. It’s a proving ground, steeped with science and engineering designed to push warships faster than ever before, and armed to confront the growing menace of a universe where everything is influenced by a hidden evil.As Van and his crew grow into their new roles, Perry unlocks a memory that reaches into the very beginning of the Tudor family’s service, nearly a century earlier.But sometimes, the truth is hidden for a reason, and Van must decide—How much does he really want to know? And how far can he take his ship, knowing there’s a price on his head?",

What I mean is there’s some forward movement progression to all of the events unfolding and by golly you got me with the mysteries. I’m so sucked in it’s ridiculous. Epic series.

        "reviewDescription": "I've had backyard starship book one as a sample downloaded for a while, but I kept ignoring it as it was made by two authors and having so many in the series. Came round to it after struggling to find something to read, read the first sample, immediately bought the book half way through, then kept buying them and reading the series back to back, and wow I was wrong to think that two authors would be a problem, this is an amazing book series. The only downside is the 14th book isn't yet available and the last one ended in the middle of things (unlike the others which round things off a bit for the current story, but still leave you wanting more).For the most part the books feel very episodic, building up the world and overarching story over each book like a good TV series. There's some unexpected turns, fun times, sad times, big space battles, small space battles, robots, aliens, humans, love interests, its all there and for the most part, well written.Now to find something that can fill the gap before June rolls around the new book drops, life will be a struggle.",

    "bookDescription": "Admiral John \"Black Jack\" Geary may have saved the Alliance only to destroy it in this thrilling and eagerly awaited continuation of the New York Times best-selling series.\nGeary believed in the Alliance. Even when he uncovered overwhelming evidence that the highest echelons of the government and fleet command were involved in secret programs and prison camps, he believed it was worth saving. He believed his duty was to see that justice was served even though some factions feared that revealing the truth would cause the Alliance to crumble.\nBut after narrowly surviving two assassination attempts when he brings evidence of the misdeeds to the capital star system, Geary realizes that some have decided the easiest way to make the Alliance's problems go away is to get rid of him. He finds himself ordered to undertake a perilous new mission outside of the reaches of human-occupied space while the Senate clashes over the evidence.\nGeary's warships must escort a diplomatic and scientific mission across the dangerous, disintegrating remnants of the Syndicate Worlds empire. But even if he can make it to Midway Star System, the gateway to alien-controlled space, Geary will face former Syndicate officials who have rebelled and regard the Alliance with deep suspicion. And that will be the easy part....",

And at least one great moment that I've been waiting for for a long time.Those complaining about the price don't understand publishing. Giving the book a bad review because of the price only punishes the author, who didn't set the price, it's not going to affect publishing's pricing model.  And the last time a book in the series came out, I paid hardcover price of over $25. This book cost less.I'm looking forward to the rest of the books in this new series.

        "reviewDescription": "I’m only going to talk about Jack Campbell’s new story Boundless in the most general terms. Boundless is a fast-moving page-turner in which Campbell picks up as many of the threads of the previous and original series (plural) as I can remember. He uses those threads to weave together a taut thriller that will propel readers to search for the pattern that will emerge in this new Outlands series.Is it essential to have read all of previous books? No, you can enjoy this thriller without having read those, but Campbell seems to get better with each story and his characters are worthy of your time.I can’t wait to see what happens next.",

Plenty of intrigue and action and a compelling story that, for me, has yet to grow stale.My one and only critique for Mr. Campbell - if he is reading this - is to write from more than one character's perspective. The entire series is strictly from the main character's point of view, thankfully still in the 'omni' rather than 'singular.' But I would love to have scenes from Desjani's perspective, or from Duellos or Carabali. I feel it would make for a far more rounded story, and certainly make the loss of some characters a lot more impactful.Well worth a read. And then anther. And then another, and another....",

En este sentido la inclusion de un personaje nuevo que tiene claro eso, y actua con ese enojo sin justificarlo ni temerlo es refrescante y agradable.-Entiendo que se quiere hacer enfasis en lo que sufren y afecta quienes van en la guerra pero hay un punto en el que se vuelven insoportables por no trabajarlo (en este sentido las decisiones de la familia Duellos me parecen tambien muy refrescantes)Por otro lado...-La trama sigue avanzando y creo que trae respuestas mas rapido-Me gusta que despues de tanto tiempo Geary sea mas decido y tome acciones para cambiar la situacion de los militares y la alianza en general (quiero suponer que esto flrma parte de la evolucion del personaje)-Hay batallas espaciales y tambien intrigas de otro estilo, lo que me gusto muchoEn resumen: Sigue siendo lo mismo con los mismo (situacion que vemos desde el segundo libro pero seguimos aqui) y la trama avanza.

Unable to withstand the wait for the translation, I got this copy.I was pleasantly surprised to see that it's easy to read, and the story told is as good as the others. If you loved the others books in this universe, it's a must have. The author succeeded in entertwining everything from his different series in this universe (Lost Stars, Genesis of the Fleet) in a way that should not lose any reader that would take up the book without reading them.Only little downside, I've spotted some editing error on some of the chapter introductions, but nothing too serious.I'll wait for the next book - until summer 2022 apparently. To lessen the weight, I just started a read over of the entire serie.",

    "bookDescription": "Admiral John “Black Jack” Geary fears the greatest threat to humanity may be itself in this gripping continuation of the New York Times bestselling series.\nAs far from explored space as any human has ever been, Geary and the Alliance fleet are on their own, protecting a diplomatic mission in territory belonging to an alien species with still-unknown motives.\nHis already complex and dangerous mission is further imperiled by deadly challenges from other human factions seeking to harm or exploit the aliens. When another alien species whose technology is far more advanced than humanity’s arrives, the stakes are raised to the highest possible level.\nOnly the most serious danger comes from an unexpected source.\nWhen presented with orders to carry out actions he believes not only are mistaken but would be contrary to the ideals of the Alliance, Geary has to finally decide whether he must invoke the power that his long-revered name holds, all the while knowing that this might endanger his entire fleet, tear apart the Alliance, and destroy everything he has fought for.",

        "reviewDescription": "This was a masterpiece of a military space opera. As I have told you before, I am one not much for military novels, but this one was excellently written and was about the characters, rather than the action, although there is plenty of action as well. The main characters John \"Black Jack\" Geary and his ships' Captain wife, Tanya Desjani are two very formidable characters in a wildly fluctuating diplomatic scene. To top it off, there are powers who want to see the famous captain and the Head diplomat fail in their trying to open diplomatic relations with the \"Dancers\", a species that had helped them in prior conflicts and doing everything they can to sabotage their efforts. I most highly recommend this trilogy and especially this book.",

        "reviewDescription": "Book Three in the Lost Fleet: Outlands series, so that would make this number fourteen in the entire Lost Fleet shebang.At the end of the previous book, Admiral Geary was sent to Dancer space to strengthen diplomatic relations with those enigmatic aliens.  He also encounters one of the Toan and a representative from a new species, the Wooareek. Unfortunately, several really big problems arise while he's trying to carry out his orders. The biggest difficulties come from humanity rather than the aliens.I really enjoyed reading this.  I love the characters!  (Ensign Duck still needs a bigger role, though.) The story unfolded at a very slow pace for a while, and then BAM! it was one complication after another.  The long scene with the arrival of the insane Alliance CEO- not a Syndic CEO- was excellent.The ending is sufficiently open-ended to allow for a sequel. I sincerely hope that he doesn't dawdle in writing another!  I'll definitely buy that sucker.",

        "reviewDescription": "Latest book in the 'Lost Fleet' series of military science fiction novels. This has been going for a while. This is the third series of books to feature the main characters from it. It's also had a spin off trilogy. And a prequel trilogy. So it's not a good jumping on point.New readers go to 'The Lost Fleet: Dauntless'. Regular ones, read on.This one runs for four hundred and forty six pages. It's divided into eighteen chapters. There's the usual list of the make up of the fleet at the start.This seems to bring the current run 'The Lost Fleet: Outlands' to a close. More on that in a moment.Anyway, picking up from the end of the last book, Geary has to contend with trying to understand the aliens called the Dancers more. With other alien species also making contact. And with new arrivals from human space. One such brings orders. That present a big problem. And a very tricky choice...You know what you're going to get with these books by now. And this provides exactly that. It doesn't disappoint, either. It does take about sixty pages to really get going. But then it never looks back. We do get all the usual moral dilemmas that Jack has re his legend. But that never gets boring. Which is good that the writing makes to make it fresh all the time.It does for the bulk of things end up being more of a story of alien human contact than space battles. But this is still really good reading. Because as ever it manages to make the aliens so completely alien, that the two sides trying to understand each other is riveting stuff.It does some solid characterisation with the scientists who are with the fleet trying to understand all this. One in particular becomes a very three dimensional creation indeed.Where this really clicks though is in the final quarter. Because the dilemmas that all the characters from the Fleet, and not just Jack, face in this section make for a fabulous page turner. I really couldn't put this down for a moment. It does offer moral food for thought to readers as well, re what you would do in the same situation. Books that make you think for yourself like that are always worth it.Then you see there's been clever plotting all along, as the way one main situation works itself out is really great and makes so much sense when you think about it.Although this does work perfectly as an end to the Outlands trilogy, there are still loose ends dangling when this finishes. So hopefully more is to come.A superb read, and one of the best in this series. Hoping it's not the end.",

    "bookDescription": "The launch of a new science fiction adventure series--by the New York Times-best selling author of the Safehold series and the Honor Harrington series  The Galactic Hegemony has been around a long time, and it likes stability--the kind of stability that member species like the aggressive, carnivorous Shongairi tend to disturb. So when the Hegemony Survey Force encountered a world whose so-called \"sentients\"--\"humans,\" they called themselves--were almost as bad as the Shongairi themselves, it seemed reasonable to use the Shongairi to neutralize them before they could become a second threat to galactic peace. And if the Shongairi took a few knocks in the process, all the better.Now, Earth is conquered. The Shongairi have arrived in force, and humanity's cities lie in radioactive ruins. In mere minutes, more than half the human race has died.Master Sergeant Stephen Buchevsky, who thought he was being rotated home from his latest tour in Afghanistan, finds himself instead prowling the back country of the Balkans, dodging alien patrols and trying to organize scattered survivors without getting killed. And in the southeastern US, firearms instructor and former Marine Dave Dvorak finds himself at the center of a growing network of resistance--putting his extended family at lethal risk, but what else can you do?On the face of it, Buchevsky's and Dvorak's chances look bleak, as do prospects for the rest of the surviving human race. But it may well be that Shongairi and the Hegemony alike have underestimated the inhabitants of that strange planet called Earth... in David Weber's Out of the Dark.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

You're like someone who recommends The Sixth Sense to someone and you start out by saying \"So Bruce Willis is a ghost.\"There is such a thing as a spoiler, and the polite thing to do is not to mention them. It is certainly possible to talk about the book without giving things away.Now my review. I came upon this book through the Warriors Anthology. Of all the twenty-ish stories in that anthology, this short story (which was then expanded into the novel you see here) was my favorite. Yes, the ending was the same.This is the first David Weber book I've read, I get the impression many of the negative reviews are by his long time \"fans\" so maybe this isn't typically what he writes. I have no preconceived notions so I judged it as is.I really enjoyed it, it is fast paced, the action and military aspects are well described, the level of detail is excellent, and I find the plot and the world he has created wholly unique. Especially given the current geopolitical climate a situation in which we're the insurgency really resonated with me. Also, unlike similar plots such as \"Independence Day\" where our technology is completely outmatched, I liked that this novel describes a much closer fight where both sides can inflict harm. I also found his explanation for the alien's vulnerability to make sense.The book basically follows the actions of part of an ancient 70,000 some year old alien \"hegemony\" as they try to subjugate Earth, they're easily able to take out our major cities and military bases, but when they start landing ground troops they become vulnerable and we give it back to them pretty good.As for the ending, I was surprised, I like being surprised, I consider it hard to surprise me. In retrospect there were signs, of course, but it is so out of left field the possibility wasn't even on my radar. It is a little deus ex machina, but I reserve that label for situations where I think the author invented ending to get out of some writer's block, out of convenience. In this case I'm pretty sure David Weber knew his ending before he wrote a word.And yes, the ending is similar to a contemporary fad, but it at least is a very unique application of that subject matter, one I've not heard of or seen before. One might say he was capitalizing on it, as if his motives affect your enjoyment of the book or not. Could he merely have been inspired by it? Maybe thinking along those lines more now because the topic is pretty popular? In any case, his reason for the ending shouldI liked the book so much, I hope he writes a sequel. Seriously, take the battle to the hegemony. Everyone likes the story of an underestimated adversary rising from the ashes like the mythical phoenix to make his antagonist regret ever proviking his ire. In the end thats what you have here. It is very pro-human, and pro-human race, and human civilization, and human exceptionalism. It writes as if we're the best species in the universe out of thousands. That is candy for people prone to patriotism like myself and others. Then it has a very surprising twist. Which, understand, when I first read it, I didn't even know there was a twist in advance, let alone what it was. I hadn't read any reviews, I thought it was straight up man vs. aliens.That is probably the best experience. Even if you read my review, I don't tell you what the twist is, but you know there is one. The best experience is if you know nothing and read it like I did to be fully surprised.On a side note, I also think this would make an excellent movie. As you say, its a fad, and would do well enough at the box office. Plus who doesn't want to see an F-22 shoot down spaceships?",

        "reviewDescription": "When I picked up this book, I could not wait to finish it.  In fact, I stayed up one whole night to read it.  Was it the theme?  Yes.  Was it the plot?  Kinda.  Was it the detailed explanation of every piece of equipment not currently known to man?  Yes and No.  Was it the character development, such as it was?  I don't know.  Was it the dialogue?  Definitely, yes.  Was it the ability of the writer to show the different points of view?  YES!It seems that I am being critical in my review but bear with me.  Somehow, despite the flaws in the story, I gave it a 4.  Why?  The book was enjoyable from start to finish.  This is what puts it up from a 3 to a 4, for me.  I loved the plot.  I loved the way Mr. Weber was able to bring me into the story.  I felt like I was Fleet Commander Thikair.  At the same time, I was Major Torino.  I was also that poor sap in the Starlander.  Speaking about Starlanders, I hated the detailed description of the machinery.  Frequently, I glanced over those pages.  The descriptions, the ones I actually read, did create a solid setting and contributed to the excellent point of view that Mr. Weber was able to show me.  The character development seemed predictable.  Everyone reacted in a predictable fashion.  The wives in the Dvorak family let their husbands go fight a war with a minimum of protest.  The military types became guerillas.  The vampires...  I wish they had entered the story sooner.  I suspect the author wanted the reader to believe all was lost and just be grateful that humanity would not be wiped off the face of the earth.  If that was his aim, he succeeded but sacrificed an element of the story.  When the book ends, one doesn't know where the vampires came from and why they are mad.  All in all, I loved this book.  I am a fan of David Weber and will continue to be so.I have one question.  This seems to be a book that was set to be the beginning of a series.  Is it?",

Some quick (and impressive) plugs for survivialism. Some intelligent aliens, though 'thin' worldbuilding there by Weber's usual standardsSo we have global partisan struggles and despite human frailty some temporary triumphs against the odds. Finally the high tech aliens are too overwhelming and just as adversity grinds humanities last hope down, finally a 'Deus ex Machina' resolution.Good, lightweight, quick read; nothing epic: Very much of the Apocalypse Troll and Dahak standard of writing. Nothing on the Treecat or Harrington level",

Die Feinde wollen natürlich die Menschheit nicht ganz ausrotten, denn die Menschen werden ja noch als Arbeitssklaven gebraucht und die Ökologie sollte auch in Ordnung bleiben.Da erstellen die Eroberer ein Psychobild der Menschen und machen etwas Neues, sie rauben Kinder und wollen sie \"perfekt\" erziehen.

The Earth is about to meet aliens. Some of the aliens are bringing goods to trade. And among those items—are weapons.When a secret cabal of humans who want to exploit the Earth is revealed, Van has to decide how and where to fight this threat.

        "reviewDescription": "One of the biggest weapons of the bad guys is not a thing but an idea - doubt. Things happen that make Van wonder and doubt who he can trust of his outer circle (nothing wrong with the inner circle....  Probably )! The  progression towards first contact hastens,  leading van to orchestrate things and minimize the ability of others to abuse the situation. New foes are identified while old foes are rooted out as much as possible.The terraforming race that restored Helso are being targeted due to their psionic abilities and so the peacemakers need to protect them leading to a number of battles and assaults while sleight of hand is employed by Dohlenz.This novel has a healthy mixture of suspense, surprises, sacrifices, mystery and revelations making for an enthralling and entertaining read. I look forward to seeing where this series will go next....",

    "bookDescription": "The alien forces known as the Lankies are gathering on the solar system’s edge, consolidating their conquest of Mars and setting their sights on Earth. The far-off colony of New Svalbard, cut off from the rest of the galaxy by the Lanky blockade, teeters on the verge of starvation and collapse. The forces of the two Earth alliances have won minor skirmishes but are in danger of losing the war. For battle-weary staff sergeant Andrew Grayson and the ragged forces of the North American Commonwealth, the fight for survival is entering a catastrophic new phase.\nForging an uneasy alliance with their Sino-Russian enemies, the NAC launches a hybrid task force on a long shot: a stealth mission to breach the Lanky blockade and reestablish supply lines with Earth. Plunging into combat against a merciless alien species that outguns, outmaneuvers, and outfights them at every turn, Andrew and his fellow troopers could end up cornered on their home turf, with no way out and no hope for reinforcement. And this time, the struggle for humanity’s future can only end in either victory or annihilation.",

        "reviewDescription": "At the onset of Angles of Attack the third book in Marko Kloos's Frontline series,  things are not looking good for humanity.  For five years, humanity has been fighting a losing battle of extermination against a seemingly invincible enemy who now stands on the doorstep of Earth about to finish us off.  Our oldest and most populous colony on Mars just fell to the Lankies , all major cities and installations have been cleansed off the planet by nerve gas and the enemy has begun terraforming the planet to meet their own biological needs.  After this defeat, a refugee fleet of the two main powers on Earth, the North American Coalition (NAC) and Sino-Russian Alliance (SRA) arrive in the New Svalbard system where our main character Staff Sergeant Andrew Grayson and a small contingent of NAC soldiers are currently holed up after a successful mutiny which saw Grayson and group of exiled Homeworld Defense soldiers disobey direct orders to seize the resources of New Svalbard from the colonists for use by the NAC.  An alliance of convenience is formed between the NAC and SRA refugee fleets, and although the two sides do not readily trust one another they are willing to integrate their forces towards the greater goal of survival.  However, given the recent influx of soldiers and sailors from the refugee fleet and the fact that the world of New Svalbard is essentially a Hoth-lite planet, the refugee fleet finds itself with two sobering options, starving to death in orbit around their new home or run the risk of running the  blockade around Earth in an attempt reestablish supply lines with Earth.  Fortunately, for our heroes the fleet does possess a state of the art spy vessel with stealth capabilities, the Indianapolis,  that they can use to hopefully break the enemy’s blockade of our solar system.  In the process of doing so they can then discover if Earth is still intact, reestablish contact and then return back to New Svalbard before the colony and fleet around the planet starve to death.  Sounds simple right?  Of course along the way in the novel, things are not always what they seem to be and a constant theme in the book is the inability of humanity and those in power to look beyond self-interest and to actually serve the greater good, even in the face of utter annihilation.All in all, Angles of Attack is a nice addition to the Frontline series and although I found this latest addition  to be the weakest of the three that have been released thus far, I still found it to be a delightfully fun and extremely enjoyable read.  Kloos has an amazing ability to pen taut, frenetic and realistic action sequences that place his readers right in the midst of the action.  Whether it is a highly kinetic firefight or the equally tense action of sneaking through an enemy blockade, Kloos' stories ooze authenticity in a way that many other military space opera novels don't.  Kloos simply does a great job detailing the culture of the militaries he writes about in addition to enumerating the preferred tactics, weapon systems and platforms of said military cultures.  When one picks up Angles of Attack or any other novel in the frontline series , one is presented with a wonderfully realized and fully believable vision of the military in the 22nd Century.In Angles of Attack, the characters in the are well written, even if they do not stray too far from established sci-fi military clichés.  The characterization for most of the characters is not particularly deep, although Kloos through the thoughts/conversations of the main character the author does attempt to deal with the idea of how the individual or even the systems created by individuals (i.e governments, bureaucracies etc) would react to the apocalypse and the the prospect of losing all that one holds dear.  Would a sense of depression or acceptance kick in , or would the animal nature of humanity strike yet again as we lash out of the corner to fight back once again against all odds?  Do we as a species come together in times of crisis or use this as a justification to grow more selfish and ensure our own survival? What if any are the ramifications of such decisions?  Heady questions to be sure, and the author just briefly  touches on them while showing the potential consequences such decisions can have on our ultimate survival.Staff Sergeant Grayson, though weary and battle hardened is given his own level of depth in the novel hidden in his real  motivations why he risks leaving the relative safety of New Svalgrad to accompany the crew of the Indianapolis on their journey back to Earth.  That was a well done touch. Kloos also does a great job portraying the military bureaucracies’ s on both the SRA and NAC sides as soulless machines, faceless and essentially unaccountable machines that grind up and leech all sense of usefulness of those within their ranks, but to what purpose?  To the end of the novel, we see a government and a military that has lost its core reason for being, and it will be interesting to see how this theme is carried on forward in the series.As you can tell, I found much to enjoy about this book.  That being said, my main criticism with the book stems from what I felt was the lack of movement in the main plot of the series.  Towards, the end of the novel, humanity is essentially in the same place as they were at the end of the second novel, Lines of Departure, and our characters though on a different planet with a different difficult decision to make are no closer to saving humanity.  Granted this may have been my own fault as I thought that this was the last book in the series, and was not aware of another upcoming novel in the series, so imagine my surprise/frustration that at the end of the book, we know little more about the Lankies than we did at the end of book two and the story has moved no closer towards either the salvation or extinction of the human race.In short, although a lot happened in the novel, it almost felt at the end like filler, enjoyable, well written filler, but filler nonetheless.  Although interesting questions are posed about the Lankies in this novel, no answers are given and three books in we still don’t know much about the Lankies, their motivations, their society, or even how their ships are made.  While this does serve the story as it makes the enemy mysterious, extremely powerful and frightening, at some point the ant, being humanity, is going to have to learn how to stop the boot of the Lankies from stomping us out of existence.  In fairness to the author however, while he does portray the enemy as semi-invincible, he has provided enough chinks in their armor that one can plausibly see how humanity will prevail. My only hope is that the next novel moves us closer to figuring out how this will be accomplished.",

        "reviewDescription": "I felt almost like there was a missing short story in between the second and third novels in the Frontline series. At the beginning of my last review I mentioned how the Russians, Chinese and Ameriicans were still feuding despite the Lankies attacking all of Earth's colonies.This books jumps right into middle of a joint operation between the Eurasian forces allied with the Americans, fighting their common alien foe. Maybe I've forgotten something.Anyway, the Earth forces out on ice planet Svalbard are soon approaching a time when they and the civilians on the planet will eat their way through all the supplies, and there has been no resupply or communication from Earth for a long time. So, a daring plan is hatched to run the Lankie blockade of the Solar System to make contact with the Earth forces and to see what can be done about relief. Our old comrades, Sergeants Grayson and Fallons, are along for the duration, and we get to live in interesting times along with them.When they arrive, the situation is very strange. Mars has been overrun, and the forces orbiting Earth do not seem to trust the returnees, quarantining the and locking down their communications. Things come to a head when they take Andrew in for interrogation, leaving him in need of rescue by some of his bad companions - another day, another mutiny.With the help of one of Andrew's new Russian friends, Dmitri, they escape the clutches of the powers on Earth (who turn out to be cowards fleeing the solar system) and re-run the blockade in reverse to report on the situation to the remainder of the fleet on Svalbard. After a deal of discussion, it's once more unto the breach for a second voyage back to the home system, where they make contact with the flight school on the Moon, where - Yay! - Andrew's fiancee, Hailey, is a flight instructor.They \"borrow\" a bunch of fighter spacecraft and their student pilots and make tracks to attack a Lankie mothership which has made it all the way into Earth orbit. Great mayhem ensues.I'm not so certain now that this is going to end as a trilogy. It appears Kloos has left room for a sequel or two. I look forward to finding out.",

No voy a añadir mucho más a lo que ya dije de los otros libros, solo que aquí demuestra que además de narrar batallas terrestres muy bien, el autor también es capaz de trasladar esa tensión a las batallas en el espacio y todo lo que se desarrolla fuera de la atmósfera, que en este libro es mucho más que en los anteriores.

    "bookDescription": "Physics doesn’t negotiate. Neither does she.\nTwelve years ago, a Polish colony found an alien warship in a debris field. Now every superpower in human space wants what they reverse-engineered.\nOn the frontier, Polonia Prime is a small, underfunded nation with one unforgivable advantage: hybrid alien drive and weapons technology that can rewrite every fleet doctrine in the Hyades Cluster.\nLieutenant Commander Maria Roszak earned her command through tactical competence, not bloodline or politics. Her destroyer Błyskawica is a relic on the outside, retrofitted inside with forbidden Bubble-drive systems, railgun batteries, and point-defense grids that skate the edge of physics. When a Zenith Caliphate carrier strike group crosses the border to seize Polonia’s secrets, Maria finds herself outnumbered, outgunned—and no longer sure her own side is playing straight.\nEvery time the enemy finds her faster than they should, suspicion grows. If she’s right about a leak in her own chain of command, exposing it could destroy her career and her ship long before the Caliphate does. To keep her crew alive and her nation independent, Maria must turn debris fields into weapons, doctrine into a disadvantage, and an obsolete destroyer into the sharpest blade in Polonia’s arsenal.\nIn a battlespace where Newtonian recoil, delta-v budgets, and railgun kinetics decide who lives, one captain’s brain is the only shield her people have left.\nFor readers who love:\nHard-science military space opera with real-physics combat (Bubble-drive micro-jumps, railguns, missiles, point defense, no magic)\nHard-science military space opera with real-physics combat (Bubble-drive micro-jumps, railguns, missiles, point defense, no magic)\nUnderdog nations, carrier strike groups, and destroyer-captain tactics under political pressure\nUnderdog nations, carrier strike groups, and destroyer-captain tactics under political pressure\nCompetent female officers, gritty tone, and respect for military professionalism\nCompetent female officers, gritty tone, and respect for military professionalism\nSeries like The Lost Fleet and The Expanse, where brains matter more than bigger guns\nSeries like The Lost Fleet and The Expanse, where brains matter more than bigger guns",

Captain Maria Roszak commands this formidable vessel through the contested regions of the Hyades Cluster, where her tactical brilliance will be tested against forces that threaten humanity's fragile peace. \nFORGED IN THE CRUCIBLE OF BATTLE \nThe Neo-Russian battlecruiser Volkov unleashes devastating firepower against Caliphate forces. These rugged vessels emphasize durability and overwhelming force projection, representing the iron will of a civilization determined to protect its hard-won territory in the Hyades Cluster through superior firepower and tactical resolve. \nMASTERY OF SPACE AND TIME \nWitness the revolutionary bubble drive in action as a Polonia Prime vessel prepares for faster-than-light travel. This alien-derived technology creates a quantum displacement field that allows ships to traverse vast interstellar distances in moments. While commercial versions enable trade throughout the Hyades Cluster, military-grade systems grant Polonia Prime's navy unprecedented tactical advantage in combat situations. \nTHE HEART OF POWER THAT DRIVES THE STARS \nThe engineering section houses Polonia Prime's revolutionary bubble drive technology, reverse-engineered from alien discoveries. This advanced propulsion system allows rapid tactical jumps between star systems, giving Polonia Prime's vessels unprecedented strategic advantage in both military operations and interstellar trade. \nELITE FORCES ON THE FRONTLINES OF HUMANITY'S DEFENSE \nPolonia Prime's marine contingents represent the cutting edge of military training and equipment. These elite troops specialize in ship-to-ship boarding actions, planetary landings, and station security operations, bringing human determination and tactical flexibility to the most dangerous environments in the Hyades Cluster.",

        "reviewDescription": "I found the quality of writing mostly very good. The story itself seems very old-school. The setting is the nearby Hyades star cluster, a young group of stars, likely to possess no living planets. The choice of the Theta stars is particularly odd, as these are mostly massive stars, short-lived and highly energetic, including one already evolved into or perhaps past it's helium flash. But most of the story seems to be on stations. And that's one of the oddities, as these station locations are very ambiguous. Some of that may be due to the \"bubble drive\" a jump drive of unclear capabilities, short, long, maybe gravity sensitive, maybe not...The heroine seems very young, but immensely capable (I say apparently, but she is chronologically early middle age). Most of her crew we meet are ensigns and privates. So, a bit of a mix of a YA story and ??? The heroine's ship is an old destroyer with some alien tech modes. Not really clear what is involved, but it does seem to be a bit of a super ship with a super tactician commanding. A bit hard to tell what pushes it in normal space, maybe some anti-inertia, but only because it seems, in a push, it can make quick reverses...  The plot is mostly a series of battles. Outside the somewhat sketchy battle scenes,  our youngish captain seems to be right in the middle of even the highest level meetings. Odd...Mostly, I found the writing above average, and some excellent. The Sci-Fi seemed to be bits and pieces, patched with no real since of realism, more like a movie.A pretty good read, but I don't think I'll go after the sequel.",

Here we see something unusual, and for fans of sci-fi, there is plenty to get your head around. So relevant to the times we are experiencing, cyber warfare is as devastating as the brains behind the politics, but the battle is always about power and greed.

We avidly follow Maria Roszak, Executive Officer on board the destroyer Blyskawica, as her innovative strategies and tactical acumen make brilliant use of the engineering and IT insight of the bridge crew. Other characters are vividly drawn and the friendly camaraderie and honed teamwork are an intrinsic part of the Blyskawica’s success. I would have appreciated more insight into what it feels like to live on a ship in space and also a better impression of travelling in space. The author gives little impression of distances and speeds, whether within systems or between stars. It does not really matter as I was gripped by the twists and turns of the story and concerns of the characters. I look forward to reading more of their adventures.",

    "bookDescription": "In New York Times-bestselling science fiction epic Out of the Dark, Earth beat back an alien invasion. Now we've got to make sure they don't come back, in Into the Light.The Shongairi conquered Earth. In mere minutes, half the human race died, and our cities lay in shattered ruins.But the Shongairi didn’t expect the survivors’ tenacity. And, crucially, they didn’t know that Earth harbored two species of intelligent, tool-using bipeds. One of them was us. The other, long-lived and lethal, was hiding in the mountains of eastern Europe, the subject of fantasy and legend. When they emerged and made alliance with humankind, the invading aliens didn’t stand a chance.Now Earth is once again ours. Aided by the advanced tech the aliens left behind, we’re rebuilding as fast as we can.Meanwhile, a select few of our blood-drinking immortals are on their way to the Shongairi homeworld, having commandeered one of the alien starships...the planet-busting kind.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

        "reviewDescription": "Book number two of a three book series of an alien invasion science fiction series.  I reread the well printed and well bound MMPB published by Tor in 2021.  I just bought the third book in the series and will be reading it soon for the first time as the second book ends on a cliffhanger.I've got vampires in my alien invasion science fiction book !  Prince Vlad Draculya, aka Vald the Impaler, lives !  Or some variant of living as he has been composed of nanobots since the middle 1400s.  He does not drink blood but he did kill thousands of Turkish muslim invaders into his beloved eastern Europe in the 1400s.  And his nanobots are solar powered so he does not eat and is virtually immortal.The first book in the series detailed an invasion by the Shongairi in which they used multiple kinetic weapons from orbit on every city on Earth of 100,000+ people and all military bases.  Half of the human population of Earth died in a matter of minutes.  Due to the fact that the Shongairi space ships could only attain six times the speed of light, their understanding of Earth technology was very outdated and they did not know that we had progressed from an agrarian society into a very industrialized society.As the first Shongairi troop ships were landing on the Earth, they were destroyed by F-22 stealth fighter jets.  As soon as the F-22 jets landed at their hidden airfields, those were also destroyed using kinetic weapons.  After the Shongairi troops rampaged through the Earth population remnants and killed half of the survivors from the initial attack, the vampires appeared out of Eastern Europe.  The vampires were virtually indestructible and rode back up on the outside of their landers to the Shongairi space ships in Earth orbit.  They then boarded the space ships and proceed to kill all the Shongairi invaders in orbit.Now the horribly damaged human population on Earth has to rebuild, both the population and the facilities.  But they have an advantage, the now empty Shongairi space ships and several Galactic Hegemony neural educators.  Vlad Dracula has taken one of the interstellar space ships with a crew of several hundred and is headed 200+ light years to the Shongairi home planet to pay back some of the damage that they did to Earth.  And one of the few remaining state governors of the USA has become the USA President and is planning on creating a one world government to fight the Galactic Hegemony.",

        "reviewDescription": "1.  First, the number of people who rated this book as 1-star based solely upon price (none of whom even read the book) is ridiculous.  Their reviews should be deleted, and their posting privileges revoked.  With that said, I agree that the price is outrageous for an e-Book.  No printing costs.  No costs for brick/mortar.  Etcetera.  Pass some of those savings to the readers, publisher.2.  Likewise, those complaining that certain plotlines \"did not advance the story\" should be ignored.  How are we to know whether those plotlines were indeed \"dead-ends\" until we seek Book Three or Book Four?  With that said, a couple of them indeed did seem to contribute little to that portion of the story which we have seen thus far.  I hope we see MORE of what happens to Cecilia, for instance.  (As an aside to the authors, some backstory on Cecilia and her sisters would have been nice.  Seriously, vampire strippers, and THAT is all you tell us?)3. I wish the authors had moved the Vampire element of the story forward along with the Conquest element of the story.  We got ... what? ... maybe three Vampire chapters?  I felt cheated.  Vlad and Stephen had DECADES to get to know one another along the voyage.  It would have been nice to see more of that than one scene in which they argue about vampire movies.4.  YES, Weber buried us in quasi-military, techno-babble.  Have you been reading long?  That is what Weber DOES.5.  We do see too many folks with near-identical personalities.  Specifically, acerbic and sarcastic.  I have a sneaking suspicion that if one were to meet Weber, one would find that he is acerbic and sarcastic.6.  I would have liked to know from the start that this book would NOT conclude the series.  With that said, the ultimate end of THIS book was painfully obvious about 1/3 of the way into the story.  Maybe that came from having read Turtledove's Homeward Bound, among dozens of other books with the same element.7.  But it was a fun read.",

        "reviewDescription": "So, first book (mild book 1 spoilers, sorry), has your typical alien invasion, except it’s atypical in that it’s us stone-throwers vs the super-tech invaders.  There’s only one way for the first book to logically end - we can scratch the aliens, but we can’t actually defeat them.  The plot continues until the 11th hour where Deus Ex Machina steps in and ruins... many things.  The invaders plans and the sanity of the story being the leading items, as the addition fails to fit properly into the story on many levels.  It felt so artificial that I...  hate, might be the right word, the story of that first book and it’s handling.That was ‘Out of the Dark’.I picked up the new book, not because I liked the first book, but because I wanted to better understand what brought about that train wreck.“Into the Light’ takes that element that didn’t fit, integrates it into the story, and explains it on several levels.  The explanation make sense.  The addition fits the larger story, and there’s even hints of world building framework that lie outside the scope of both books, which can allow for a third book in the series.If you hated how the first book ended, like me, you may see closure of that anger with this book.  Or you may find new reasons to hate the series.  Or like it.  What the first book did was so far outside what I’d consider normal story design that I think it’s fair to say that readers of the second book may find their expectations of the story may be betrayed by this new work, for better or worse.I may rate the second book very favorably... that doesn’t mean I’m changing my opinion of the first book any - I understand now what happened to the first book.  That understanding doesn’t mean I approve of the process that lead to the first book being what it is, but it did at least set the stage for book two,  and the second book did not disappoint me.",

TO SEE ON THE DAVID WEBER WEBSITE THE NEXT SAFEHOLD BOOK IS SCHEDULED TO BE WRITTEN – HOPEFULLY PUBLISHED IN 2021Agree very much with a previous reviewer’s comment “MARMITE BOOK ALERT - Of course, it's a marmite book, everything David Weber writes or contributes to is loved by some people and loathed by others but I suspect that may be even more true of this one than most.”",

    "bookDescription": "The universe is hungry.For power. For money. For war.And—revenge. Stripping osmium from across the stars, thieves will stop at nothing to fuel the nightmarish industry of Stolen Persons, their souls locked away in chips made of the rarest metal known.Among these thieves is Helum Gauss, the visionary criminal whose empire spans a hundred worlds. But his massive corporation, BeneStar, lost—badly—to Van and the Guild, and Gauss won’t take no for an answer.To that end, he’ll hit Van where it hurts the most.Family.Lost among the Stolen Persons, Carter Yost is far from home, angry, and spoiling for a fight, and BeneStar is the perfect method for revenge on Van, the Guild, and the forces of justice. To BeneStar CEO Helem Gauss, murder isn’t a crime. It’s just part of doing business, and with a trillion bonds at stake, Gauss declares war on anyone who stands in his way of absolute authority.BeneStar tried guns. They tried missiles. They tried galactic media, and they still lost. Now, they’ll use an enraged soul captured between life and death, and one last weapon that frightens employees everywhere. The Human Resource Department.Gauss will unleash his most vicious division of bureaucrats -- and a league of attorneys whose sole job is to crush opponents by any means necessary. BeneStar will fight in court, in the public forum, or in the depths of space, where laws and missiles can end a Peacemaker’s career forever. The mercenaries and pirates, all armed to the teeth, are an added bonus for BeneStar, whose navy ranks among the most powerful in known space.In a war for control of the hearts and minds of everyone in The Deeps, Van and his crew are going to win— or die trying.",

        "reviewDescription": "Another good book in the series. This book is pretty much more of the same compared to the previous books and, in this case, that is good.I was a bit worried when I read the book blurb. Especially the phrase “Gauss will unleash his most vicious division of bureaucrats — and a league of attorneys whose sole job is to crush opponents by any means necessary“. I was afraid this book would turn into a bunch of (censored by Amazon) politics and legal (censored by Amazon) but luckily that did not really happen.Instead this book advanced the story quite a lot up to and including the final action filled showdown with the despicable Mr. Gauss. Finally, I might add. It was about time that we got to the end of this story arc. I cannot image the author successfully managing to squeeze more out of it. And we got that (censored by Amazon) Carter taken out of the equation, also finally, at the same time which just adds to the pleasure of reading this book.Otherwise the book has the usual bantering, (censored by Amazon)-kicking and so on and so forth. It is a good science fiction adventure plain and simple.Now I have to say (or write) that I am quite interested in learning where the author goes from here. Apparently the series do continue.",

I wonder where his battle name, 'Blood Wolf' came from? *wink. Getting started on the next one and hoping for more fun, tense moments and that southern drawl of Geister.

Transportation is like Warp Speed in Star Trek. You go way too fast but stop instantly.

        "reviewTitle": "Jar-Heads in Space",
        "reviewDescription": "Recruit: The United Federation Marine Corps by Jonathan Pl Brazee.This is a story about space marines.  I know! There have been a LOT of \"Jar-Heads in Space\" novels.  I know that. But darn it, I like stories like this.  I confess, I am not a Marine.  I served with the US Army.  Still this is a good read.  It reminds me of classic Heinlein \"Starship Troopers\" (minus the political lectures).  And this story is not about killing bugs.  They are killing people:  rebels, pirates, subversives, and the like.It is a coming of age story about a farm boy, Ryck Lysander,  who joins the space marines and succeeds in being a true-blue warrior, but he suffers a lot of bumps in the road along the way.What I Liked:Pretty much everything.  The author has a military background (he is a retired Marine) and it shows.  The focus on Ryck, his enlistment, boot training, his wars, all of it  sounds authentic and believable.  Brazee is a good writer.  His story-telling and world building are both well done.  The editing is pretty good.  i saw a few comma mistakes, but not enough to detract from the story.  It is a clean read.  This is not a novel that insists on loading every paragraph with obscenities.What I Did Not Like:The book is too short.  I would have liked a bit more backstory.  It was hard to figure out what was going on.  I wanted more about the big picture.Conclusion:This is a perfect read for someone who likes the military science fiction genre.  I liked it very much.",

        "reviewDescription": "I enjoy this sub-genre of SF - boy reluctantly enlists, endures boot camp and becomes a man on the battlefield.  It has been done many times before and it would be hard to come up with something new.  However, Mr Brazee has some inventive  fresh twists in what obviously is the first installment in a series.This type of novel is was it is.  It is intended as a light-to-medium-weight work of FICTION and is directed to a Military SF audience.  If imaginary Marines in an imaginary future do something differently to what real present day Marines do, it is hardly a reason to criticise the book - or the author. Some people take themselves all too seriously and really should lighten up a little.  Or better still - have a go at writing your own book and then have someone sneer at your efforts or harumph at the morals of one of your fictional characters.Having said that, I personally found the military side of things accurate - I really don't know what some reviewers are are on about.  As a former soldier myself (although not US) with some experience in section and platoon tactics, I could recognise someone who knows what they are talking about.  It was also good to see no bizarrely futuristic ray-gun type weapons and the firearms described in the novel felt like a natural progression of current weaponry.A decent book.  Some editing errors, but that is to be expected in this digital age. Story flowed well and keeps the reader engaged.  As I said, it is what it is and I like it.I look forward to the next novel - which I shall buy if only to spite some of the anal retentive types that write reviews here.",

        "reviewDescription": "Lots of action. Tech, but not too much. Main character not a Rambo, but not a wimp either. Has his ups & downs, but isn't a self-agonizer. He figures out when he messes up, and he does mess up at times. The author has a clear writing style that presents a lot of character aspects that many Marine-In-Space stories fall short on. Of course, this isn't the o-n-l-y style of Space Marine story out there but it deserves to be in the top ranks of them. It was entertaining and I appreciated its informative passages. Thank you, Mr. Brazee.Update: 6/1/21I've now read all of the books in this series. Ryck Lysander progresses from raw recruit all the way to... well... you'll find out. It's quite a career arc. I enjoyed it all, but if I could have wished for anything I'd like to have seen a little more hard action in space. But, as he's a marine I can understand why the scope in that area doesn't offer quite the same opportunities as if he was a pilot and came up via that route. Pretty much a page-turner all the way.",

The rest showed a real understanding of what it takes to be a grunt, and the details created a convincing Corps.The Marine Corps development was excellent. The use of footnotes helped, but I knew or could figure out most of them. It was a good idea, whether it was from the author or his editor.Some characters were too shallow, but Ryck did show development, just not as much as I expected. This kid had a lot to learn about the world and himself. The details of what the world threw at him felt real, but his reactions did not show how he internalized the drama and grew from it.I hope that in Sargent, we get to see his core being. Excellent work, Sir (my dad worked for a living 😊).",

Recruit / book 1on a Saturday , and found myself so engrossed with the story i finished book 8 on the following TuesdayHighly recommend the series( Semper Fi Press is a boutique publisher so i understand why the printed versions cost so much but i could not recommend buying the paperback editions )",

        "reviewDescription": "A bit clunky in parts and could have done with proof reading, I hate it when words are there which should have been deleted, normally you can work out that the author started along one line of thinking and then changed his or her mind but left an extraneous word behind, but there are just too many.Also a grammar and spellcheck would have helped, indeed that alone would have got rid of the obvious problems.That moan over it is a good yarn that gets over the gut wrench when you lose a friend, there one minute not the next. It gives a credible start and shows how the direction of a life can be changed from something as simple as being bored of waiting. In this case the hero was enlisting in one organisation but ended up in another because he had been left with no explanation for a long delay.Written by a marine for marines it gives a good idea of the camaraderie in any service.",

With their sights set on a hidden Syndicate base brimming with alien secrets, holding the team together long enough to claim the prize will be their greatest test yet.\nLeading a crew of outcasts, Evan and Anya stage a high-stakes raid to seize tech that could turn the tide against Chancellor Rostov’s iron grip.

But when they find a critical lead about the Korani’s trail across the stars, they’ll stop at nothing to get answers.\nWith Rostov’s forces closing in, can Evan and Anya wield their growing power to spark a rebellion—or will it consume them?\nRebel Worlds is the exciting third installment in the Starship of the Ancients series. If you like planet-hopping sci-fi adventures with dynamic characters, alien worlds, and interstellar intrigue, then you'll love this thrilling space opera by author A.K.

        "reviewDescription": "A great continuation for the Starship of the Anicents series. Evan and Anya, caught up in a political power struggle they never imagined, finally take a side and go all in. Not content to sit on the sidelines or hop across the galaxy and wait for things to play out, they take Sam (the ship's sentient AI) and explore other alien artifact sites. What they find makes them question all sides of the conflict, but they ultimately feel they've made the correct decision in taking sides. Not content to consolidate power in a select few, they work out a plan on how to share with a greater group and begin to show the universe the changes coming. The revelation at the end has me anxious to see how the next book plays out!Pros:- Realistic Computer (AI) - Does exactly what's told, doesn't volunteer information thinking it's as obvious as breathing.- Protagonist isn't some royalty or rich guy who is temporarily down on his luck. He's a regular soldier who had his cover blown and had to escape, only to be thrust into an unfortunate series of events. He approaches things guardedly, but honestly and doesn't care if the person is the CEO or the janitor. He's working toward the greater good and is questioning the \"authority\" before making his decisions.- Sharing the wealth - easy enough for one person to hoard a lucky find of riches or abilities. The protatonist is sharing access to the ship and the powers it holds with others, not content to consolidate power in a select few.Cons:- Characters can be a bit whiny and do dumb stuff....annoying to me, but also indicative of good writing.- I find myself wanting more description at times. The story moves fast, but at times I feel I'm missing a bit of the flavor of the world Ms DuBoff has build.",

The characters are interesting and believable, and there are several intricate story lines unfolding. Some things were quite predictable for me though. My only problem is way too many dialogues that sound artificial sometimes, and too much action and politics in this book was tiring. I'd love more exploration of the alien worlds and beings that the author has no problem creating with her imagination. Since there was no conclusive ending and the next book hasn't come out yet I'm not sure I'll have interest in continuing reading after several months.",

        "reviewDescription": "I am often surprised with the peculiar worlds authors can imagine and bring to light. When Evan and Anya pursue leads to try and find lux, the alien fluid  containing nanites and that holds the key to Evan's new developing abilities, they discovered a secretive world that somehow reminds me of a smaller Jupiter. And this world hides a secret base with lots of laboratories.And lots of lux.The problem? This base serves the arch villain Rostov and is well protected.What follows is hair raising.Author AK Duboff certainly crafted a very immersive plot with intriguing characters...such as the captured villain Damon who gradually discovers some humanity developing in his psyche.Or the developing relationship between Evan and Anya.It is anyhow going to grab your attention and keep you in it's grip non stop to the end.Enjoy.",

    "bookDescription": "From the author of the amazon best selling Empire Rising series comes a new epic saga.For over two millennia, humanity has lived under the unyielding peace of the Human Republic. Born from the ashes of a devastating revolt, the Republic vowed to prevent the nuclear holocaust of another interstellar war at any cost. Its inner core worlds—thirteen powerful colonies—maintain an iron grip over the thousands of outlying planets humanity has settled.But peace has come at a price.Two and a half thousand years of centralized rule, greed, and corruption have all but enslaved those who live outside the Republic’s inner core. For the citizens of these rim worlds, freedom is a distant dream—a relic buried in humanity’s past.Yet what has been buried cannot be hidden forever.For those who strive for these long lost ideals, they will soon discover what so many before them have learnt the hard way – freedom always comes at a cost.For Second Lieutenant Caleb Hawthorne, the cost will be higher than he can imagine. When a secessionist movement arises, Caleb must choose between the navy he has dedicated his life to and his loyalty to family and homeworld. As the tyranny of his masters becomes clearer, there is only one choice. But can he learn the ways of war fast enough to make a difference? And can he throw off the ties that bind him to the Republic so easily?Freedom, family, and love are powerful rallying cries, but can they inspire a people to accomplish what no one has done in nearly three thousand years— to forge a nation of their own?Embers of Rebellion is the first novel in the Secession Wars series by D. J. Holmes that will tell the sweeping story of the Rim's quest for freedom from the Republic and all the war, loss, and devestation that will arise from a peoples' striving to be free.",

As always, Holmes paints a vivid picture of space warfare. The ship battles start small, but if the Empire Rising series is anything to go by, things will escalate significantly in coming books. As always , the most annoying thing is having to wait the three or so months until the next one. If you liked this one and haven't tried the Empire Rising series yet, I recommend purchasing a copy of Void War and I also envy you just starting out on this awesome series.",

    "bookDescription": "In this military SF thriller, a colony on one of Jupiter’s moons will either be the last bastion of human civilization . . . or ground zero for its extinction.At long last, humanity has moved beyond Earth and begun seeding new worlds. Colonies extend across the solar system, from Luna to Mars to Saturn’s satellite Titan. Even Jupiter’s moon Europa has become home to a couple thousand brave souls willing to risk their lives adapting to its frozen and deadly landscape.After his previous mission in Africa ended in a violent uprising in which he lost every man under his command, Lt. Ryan Braeder’s posting to Europa is his last chance to salvage a military career that’s in tatters. Here on Jupiter’s moon, he’s been tasked with easing tensions between the military and an unruly civilian board.It seems the governor and his cronies are attempting to usurp military command in a play for control. But Braeder’s diplomatic efforts are met with defiance as mistrust grows on both sides, threatening the colony’s safety. And that’s before events Earthside turn his world upside down.Braeder can only watch helplessly as war erupts on his home planet, releasing a biological plague that sweeps the globe. Supply transports to the colonies are canceled. In a few short months, Braeder’s friends, his family—everyone he has ever known—are dead. The human race hovers on the brink of extinction.Now, Braeder’s got one chance to save the colony on Europa. Can he implement a ration plan that borders on starvation, avoid a full-blown mutiny, and prevent Earth’s survivors from bringing the deadly plague? One thing’s for sure: the future of his species depends on it.“An interstellar yarn wrought with suspense and indelible characters.” —Kirkus Reviews“Leviathan Wakes meets Battlestar Galactica in this high-stakes story of survival on the moon of Jupiter. Heart-pounding and thrilling, Extinction follows an unlikely leader as he races to save humanity against impossible odds.” —Claire Barner, author of Moonrising\n“This insightful glimpse into our possible future is a must read.” —Sue Nelson Buckley, author of The Trouble with Jake and Hiding in Plain Sight\"Packed with intense action, layered characters, and thought-provoking dilemmas . . . This is a story that lingers, making you ponder the fragile line between extinction and survival.” —Literary Titan",

Lieutenant Ryan Braeder is a flawed man who is thrust into an impossible leadership role when Iran releases a biological virus that devastates the Earth's population. It serves as a frightening reminder of the real possibility of mass destruction, with stories that feel like they could be ripped from today's headlines.Now, with no resupply ships coming from a dead home world, the small colony of Europa is the last known human settlement in existence. As food rationing and power struggles arise, the Governor and the council find themselves in conflict with the military, putting Lieutenant Braeder's new command to the test.The book features many of the twists and turns I’ve come to expect from Simon. It was a fun and fast read with well-developed characters, high tension, and an unexpected, thrilling ending. I highly recommend it, and I’m already pre-ordering book two.",

    "bookDescription": "A billion years in the future, humanity is extinct.But Shakespeare remains.A machine civilization, so far advanced that it has the power to recreate lost civilizations, stumbles upon the works of the playwright, William Shakespeare.With only those plays to represent humanity, the machines must decide whether humanity is worth resurrecting or not.The only way to know the plays is to stage them.Enter J-9, although she prefers to be called Janine. She is a human-like construct, created by the machines, to enter and experience the plays of Shakespeare, as they run in simulation, indistinguishable from reality.Based on Janine’s impressions of humanity, drawn from her experiences of living within the unfolding plays, the machines will render their judgment: is humanity worth saving or shall we be consigned to oblivion?The stakes are higher than the Bard could have ever imagined.Created by Ted Neill, the Post Apocalyptic Space Shakespeare remains true to the plots of William Shakespeare’s plays while introducing stage directions that make the text more accessible to modern readers. The addition of Janine as an outsider looking in—and caught up in her own story framing the action of the plays—provides commentary and insight usually buried in academic papers but delivered here with heart and humor. It’s an original take on classic plays that will remind readers why the plays endure five hundred, and maybe five billion, years after they were written. Traditionally, Shakespeare’s plays, do not need to be read in a particular order. These “simulations,” do have an order, especially as Janine’s story evolves with them.Simulation Order:HamletOthelloTwelfth NightAs You Like ItA Mid-Summer Night’s DreamMuch Ado About NothingTaming of the ShrewRomeo & JulietCymbelineThe TempestMacBethRichard IIITroilus & CressidaPericlesKing LearJulius CesarAnthony & Cleopatra\nHamlet\nHamlet\nOthello\nOthello\nTwelfth Night\nTwelfth Night\nAs You Like It\nAs You Like It\nA Mid-Summer Night’s Dream\nA Mid-Summer Night’s Dream\nMuch Ado About Nothing\nMuch Ado About Nothing\nTaming of the Shrew\nTaming of the Shrew\nRomeo & Juliet\nRomeo & Juliet\nCymbeline\nCymbeline\nThe Tempest\nThe Tempest\nMacBeth\nMacBeth\nRichard III\nRichard III\nTroilus & Cressida\nTroilus & Cressida\nPericles\nPericles\nKing Lear\nKing Lear\nJulius Cesar\nJulius Cesar\nAnthony & Cleopatra\nAnthony & Cleopatra",

        "reviewTitle": "Something rotten in the mainframe: Speak the speech, machine!",
        "reviewDescription": "In Hamlet: Book 1 of the Post Apocalyptic Space Shakespeare Series, Ted Neill envisions a speculative future where humanity has long since vanished, yet remnants of its culture—namely, the oeuvre of William Shakespeare—persist as fragments accessible to a hyper-advanced machine civilisation. This civilisation, governed by a sentient Core and its High Council, undertakes a moral inquiry into whether the extinct human race merits resurrection. Their metric for such an existential decision? The simulated staging of Shakespearean drama. The novel centres on J-9—who adopts the name Janine—a synthetic entity engineered to embody human likeness, who is tasked with experiencing Hamlet from within its meticulously reconstructed narrative environment. Assisted by Otto, a polymorphic companion, Janine must traverse Elsinore not merely as a spectator but as an embedded participant tasked with extracting data on human ethos, emotion, and behaviour.Neill’s formal structure interlaces the Elizabethan language of Shakespeare’s original with meta-dialogues in modern vernacular between Janine and Otto, effectively creating a palimpsest where past and future cohabit. The shift in Janine’s own diction over time—veering increasingly into iambic rhythms—serves as a subtle literary device illustrating her assimilation into the human psychological register. The integration of post-human cognition within the thematic architecture of revenge, grief, and moral decay renews the canonical text’s relevance within a speculative ethics framework.Though the wider context of the post-apocalyptic universe is only loosely sketched, this open-endedness appears deliberate, reserving ontological revelations for later volumes. What the novel accomplishes, however, is an original interrogation of Shakespeare as both a cultural artefact and a litmus test for species worth. Neill’s synthesis of dramaturgy and speculative fiction challenges assumptions about civilisation’s legacy and the translatability of its moral imagination. In recasting Hamlet as a trial for humanity’s redemption through digital dramaturgy, Hamlet: Book 1 positions itself as an inventive cross-genre experiment—part literary criticism, part sci-fi thought experiment, and part philosophical inquiry into the durability of human meaning beyond human life.",

        "reviewDescription": "In a future set a billion years from now, sentient machines run the world, born from a deity-like supercomputer known as the Core. Humanity, those who created the core, are on the brink of extinction. Thus, a high council is tasked with the duty of deciding whether to save our species or not.To this effect, J-9 is created. She is tasked with observing human nature through the cast of one of its greatest playwrights- William Shakespeare. This unique twist on Shakespeare brings back the classic tale of Hamlet, peppered with new characters and observations from a modern, even futuristic perspective.I like that Janine isn't just an external observer though. She is very much a part of the plays, and can interact, form bonds, and build relationships with the characters. Although she is tasked to be an observer, she can be much more, which adds layers of depth to the story. Whats more, save for the first introductory pages, this book does not feel like a post-apocalyptic space book- a trap the author could have very easily fallen into. It feels grounded. Otto, a robot given to J-9 at the start of her journey, acts like the homely sidekick. To readers, he may as well be the furry owl friend we are used to.Janine’s journey is a wonderful retelling of a classic tale. It is also an examination of humanity.",

        "reviewDescription": "As someone who’s been wanting to re-read some of Shakespeare’s plays but never quite managed to find the time, I was pleasantly surprised to come across Hamlet: Book 1 of the Post Apocalyptic Space Shakespeare Series by Ted Neill, with original text by William Shakespeare. The premise is fascinating: Shakespeare's Hamlet retold within a post-apocalyptic framework where the very question of humanity's survival hangs in the balance. A High Council, tasked with this monumental decision, initiates a simulation, and into this simulation steps J-9, the latest in a series of constructs designed to be indistinguishable from a human. Christening herself with the more “human” name Janine, she, along with her companion Otto—another construct capable of transforming into any object—are instructed to gather data on human nature by observing simulated versions of Shakespeare’s plays, specifically Hamlet in this volume, and report their findings back to the High Council.The narrative is structured entirely like a play. While the original text of Hamlet retains its classic iambic pentameter, the dialogue between Janine and Otto is in contemporary English. Over the course of the story, Janine's own speech patterns occasionally incorporate iambic pentameter as she becomes more deeply immersed in the tragic landscape of Elsinore, a clever indicator of her deepening connection to the human experience she is meant to be observing. However, Janine and Otto often comment on and explicitly spell out the motivations and subtext of characters' actions mid-scene. While this could be helpful for readers less familiar with Hamlet, those more familiar with the play might find this explanatory approach akin to a rather insistent high school English lesson, leaving little room for individual interpretation.As the first volume in a series, the book deliberately leaves many aspects of its post-apocalyptic setting shrouded in mystery, meaning readers seeking immediate answers will need to wait for future installments. Despite the occasional heavy-handed exposition, the novel's core theme resonates, suggesting that even across centuries, the fundamental human story of Hamlet—its sorrows, betrayals, and tragedies—remain relevant to the human experience. I appreciated the fresh take on Hamlet that made this more than just another re-publication of Hamlet, finding myself more intrigued with the mysteries surrounding Janine’s creation and the goals of the High Council as the narrative went on. I am eagerly looking forward to where Janine and Otto's journey will take them next.",

Janine and Otto are awesome. It was like I was reading/watching the play through their eyes. And I was actually able to understand things I didn’t before. It was fun. Moving on to Othello. It’s just so weird I’m wanting to jump into Shakespeare again. All it took was to give me a cyborg and her robot familiar to go with.",

Now, Captain John “Black Jack” Geary, who returned to the fleet after a hundred-year suspended animation, must keep the Alliance one step ahead of its merciless foe…\nAfter a series of deadly engagements, the Alliance fleet is severely damaged and its arsenal is running low. Forced to halt in the Baldur Star System to raid the Syndic mines for raw materials, Geary is anxious to get moving again. But what should the fleet’s next move be? The Syndics are starting to catch on to Geary’s tactics, and as the Alliance ships jump from system to system, it’s getting harder to keep one step ahead.\nWhat’s more, Geary has started to piece fragments of intelligence together into a highly disturbing picture: The Syndics have been keeping the existence of another potential player in the war a secret--and this unknown power may have the means to annihilate the human race…",

        "reviewTitle": "Continuing the Escape",
        "reviewDescription": "Courageous (2008) is the third naval SF novel in the Lost Fleet series, following Fearless.  The initial work in this sequence is Dauntless.In the previous volume, thirty-nine ships left the fleet in Strabo and jumped elsewhere.  Thirteen surviving ships were retrieved in Ilion.  Falco had slipped into insanity.  Geary promoted Cresida to Captain.  Rione became Geary's lover for a few weeks.In this novel, Jack Geary is the designated acting commander of the fleet survivors.  He is the most senior captain within the Alliance due to his century long stasis is an escape pod.  Unfortunately, he is also trapped within his own legend.Tanya Desjani is an Alliance Captain, commanding the Dauntless.  She is Geary's Flag Captain.  She is younger than Geary expects of a battle cruiser commander, but the attrition rate in the Alliance navy has resulted in young ship captains.Victoria Rione is the Co-president of the Callas Republic and a member of the Alliance Senate.  She is the only civilian within the fleet.Roberto Duellos is an Alliance Captain, commanding the battlecruiser Courageous.  He is an advisor to Geary.Tyrosian is an Alliance Captain, commanding the fast fleet auxiliary Witch.  She was promoted to commander of the fleet auxiliary division after Geary transferred Captain Gundel to other duties.Tulev is an Alliance Captain, commanding the battlecruiser Leviathan.  He is an advisor to Geary.Jaylen Cresida is an Alliance Captain, commanding the battlecruiser Furious.  She is an advisor to Geary.Badaya is an Alliance Captain, commanding the battlecruiser Illustrious.Casia is an Alliance Captain, commanding the battleship Conqueror.  His ship in the Third Battleship Division, formerly commanded by Numos.Gaes is an Alliance Commander, commanding the heavy cruiser Lorica.Jin is an Alliance Commander, commanding the battleship Orion.  She replaced Numos.Carabali is an Alliance Colonel.  She is the senior officer among the remaining Marines of the fleet.Numos is an Alliance Captain, formerly commanding the battleship Orion and the Third Battleship Division.  Now he is under arrest and awaiting a courtmartial back in Alliance space.Faresa is an Alliance Captain, formerly commanding the battleship Majestic within the Third Battleship Division.  Now she is under arrest and awaiting a courtmartial.In this story, the fleet exits the jump point in the Baldur system.  Everything looks good except for some critical shortages in the fleet auxiliaries.  They need to replenish trace elements used to manufacture fuel cells and other expendables.  Geary is somewhat peeved at Tyrosian for the problem, but she still seems the best choice to head the fleet auxiliaries.Geary is worried about Syndic sabotage of stockpiles, so he plans a quick raid on some mining ventures.  He puts Colonel in charge of planning the raid.  Then he sets up a conference to brief his ship commanders.Numos and Faresa are under arrest and cannot attend, but Jin and Casia voice similar objections.  Duellos, Tulev, and Desjani counter their arguments.  Even Commander Gaes speaks in favor of the fleet commander.The fleet cruises past various Syndic installations, taking out crucial facilities with hell-lance fire.  When they near the mining facility, the ships launch shuttles loaded with Marines to secure the site.  Then the engineers go down to supervise the loading of the minerals on their shuttles.After retrieving the shuttles, Geary has another conference of his ship commanders.  Badaya mentions the effects of destroying the hypernet gate at Sancere and wonders if it such effects could be used against the Syndics.  Cressida, Tulev and Duellos provide several reasons why that would be a bad idea.Geary then announces a change in route.  Casia complains again and Geary's supporters counter his objections.  After the meeting is over, Duellos stays behind to discuss plans.  Geary finally learns why the battleship commanders are not as bright as battlecruiser skippers.This tale takes the fleet to Sendai, a system containing not much more than a black hole.  The singularity has devoured most of its system.  It gives the Alliance crews the creeps.The fleet is eager to jump to Daiquon.  The next installment in this series is Valiant.Highly recommended for Campbell fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of naval strategy, fleet battles, and living legends.  Read and enjoy!-Arthur W. Jordin",

If you can get past the rather un-realistic presumption that a cryo-frozen war hero captain from 100 years ago is given and admiral's fleet to command and runs the fleet all over enemy territory then the rest is just exciting.  Great space combat action with fleets engaging each other in pretty realistic scenes.  The character development is solid though a few of the interactions are questionable to say the least overall they're quite enjoyable.  I'd get the whole first series!",

        "reviewTitle": "Continues to be some of the finest Military Science Fiction ever written",
        "reviewDescription": "Courageous (Book #3) picks up right where Fearless (Book #2) leaves off in the Lost Fleet series by Jack Campbell. The fleet is still under the command of Captain John \"Black Jack\" Geary, and they are still trying to head for home. The disasterous results of the mutiny are fully felt in this book, and the author's long game plan is slowly revealed in this book, with hints of a hidden alien species playing both sides of the war for their own interests.Geary's old fashioned and non-insane ways of doing things continue to be proven right, and amidst the personnel struggles he has to deal with, a new threat starts to make itself known to him, and with it, suspicions of dangerous powers that could change the face of galaxy for both sides of the war.The book is a fast paced, nail-biting thriller that includes plenty of the best the military tradition has to offer in the way of: duty, honor, valor and brotherhood. The book features space battles, revenge, some romance, and diplomacy done the Marine-way. The story is told in the best traditions of Star Trek and Star Wars, and fans of those series should feel right at home here. The story has no graphic violence, and very little regular violence. I can only start reading one of these books on a Friday night or Saturday, because I WILL sit there and read the whole thing cover to cover, until I am done -- regardless of if I have to go into work tomorrow or not. Not many authors can cause me to show up for work on 2 hours of sleep, but Jack Campbell can.5 stars.---------------------------------Book Content Guide For Parents:---------------------------------Sex & Nudity: [2/5] there are brief sex/nudity scenes in the book with minimal detail -- \"and she shared his bed\" sort of stuff. Characters also discuss sexual relationships in the book from time to time, but not in detail.Violence & Gore: [1/5] fairly minimal, sometimes the marines are sent out, and we get some general descriptions, but almost all of the story takes place aboard the space ships, so any violence is via naval space battles, which do result in the deaths of people, but they are never described, so feel very abstract.Profanity: [1/5] minimal, not nearly as much or as often as you might expect from a military science fiction story.Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking: [1/5] minimal. I don't recall and smoking or drug use, and alcohol use is mainly limited to occasional drinks or reference to drinks, never characters getting drunk or glorifying it.Frightening/Intense Scenes: [2/5] the ships and crew are in mortal danger pretty much all of the time while behind enemy lines, and all of the space battles involve the threat of destruction for everyone in the battle.",

        "reviewDescription": "This is really a review for the whole series, rather than just this book. I was minded to give it a lower rating, because I seemed to finish the books quite quickly, which made me wonder about value for money; having used the Kindle versions, I hadn't seen the physical copies until I visited a bookshop recently. The books are a fair size, they just sucked me in so that I couldn't put them down, and THAT is why I finished quickly.Unlike many science fiction films, where combat in space looks like combat in an atmosphere, Jack Campbell has applied real world physics to his combat sequences. Fleets close at significant fractions of the speed of light, rely on automated systems for weapons targeting and the moment of contact is a tiny fraction of a second in which ships and crews die. It then takes half an hour or more to change vectors for another attack run. This is science fiction that puts its grounding in science, but that doesn't get in the way of reading it. It is also not afraid to depart from real world science to allow interstellar travel.As with any series, it suffers from the fact that the author has to assume that a reader is picking up a book without having read the ones before. If you read it all, it can get tedious to read about the virtual conferencing software, the maximum relative speed at which systems can target enemy vessels, the time it takes to observe and react to events occurring at light hours of distance and so on, but this repetition is a necessity in any series, so I cannot mark it down for that.The main themes of the series are the military conflict between the Alliance and the Syndicate and political conflicts within the Alliance. Personal relationships are explored to the extent that they support the main themes, so they don't become a distraction. Campbell rarely gives detais of thing like physical appearance, leaving the reader to fill in the blanks. This means that there is a significant amount of action, one reason the books are hard to put down.One thing that I found very refreshing is that this is a universe where military officers are actually portrayed as professionals, instead of the sorts of offerings we have on television today, where some people are unable to open their mouths without saying something that would get a film rated \"15\" in the UK (\"R\" in the USA?). These books seem to suggest that, whatever mistakes humanity may make along the way, such as the war that is being explored here, humanity can eventually learn to be better than it is.Having got to the end of the review, I am now thinking, is there anything in here that an Alliance politician would construe as a veiled criticism? I hope not, because I have thoroughly enjoyed reading these books.",

It's still good light entertainment but it needs some more depth, none of the secondary characters ever seem to grow or change very much. My favorite are the conoku, they do show hints of change and maturing but just tiny ones. Just to shake things up how about they show some agency and hijack the Iowa for some mission they think is important?

But if these treasonous humans, who worship alien invaders as gods, are to be finally defeated, it means cutting off the supply of weapons and equipment from their Thephari overlords... ... if Briggs and his team can find out how they are doing it.All the autonomous bomb drones, rail guns, pulse rifles, or even MOCOMs in the galaxy can't make a difference while the Thephari's advanced technology--and supply routes--remain a mystery.So when an opportunity presents itself for Briggs to find out a way to hurt the Scaleys and disrupt their control over the rebels, he must take it. Even if it means putting himself alone, compromised, vulnerable and constantly facing the prospect of sudden death.Without MOCOMs. Without friends, support, or communication...Titus Briggs will find a way to cripple the Thephari's plans for a second invasion of Earth... or he'll die trying.",

        "reviewDescription": "This series has been a joy to read. Its a deceivingly simple series, but so much more complex and layered than expected. The books have been evolving, and giving more depth of character and plot as Van can handle...and we the readers can handle. So many sci fi books bombard a main character with insane levels of tech and knowledge, and they just absorb it and become heros. Van as he has progressed has been a completely believable character, as has his development and knowledge gained. As well as the reasons for delays in knowledge. The veneer of space is just that. There is much more going on behind the scenes that most never see. In this book we are getting the curtain pulled back further, to see the mechanations going on, that the majority of peacekeepers never know about  great book, and series.",

Keep it up and I’ll be a fan for life.That being said, you should definitely hire a proofreader or editor. The typos, misspelling, missing/extra words and story line contradictions make fore some very tricky reading.Some of the blame for crappy editing should be placed squarely on AMAZON.  Please set some kind of standards. People spend way too much money on Kindle for you all to not care about quality standards.",

The Traitor Host of Horus Lupercal tightens its iron grip on the Palace of Terra, and one by one the walls and bastions begin to crumple and collapse. Rogal Dorn, Praetorian of Terra, redoubles his efforts to keep the relentless enemy at bay, but his forces are vastly outnumbered and hopelessly outgunned. Dorn simply cannot defend everything. Any chance of survival now requires sacrifice, but what battles dare he lose so that others can be won? Is there one tactical stroke, one crucial combat, that could turn the tide forever and win the war outright?",

        "reviewDescription": "I've read about 20 of the 50 some-odd novels in the Horus Heresy series. When recommending them, I usually say, \"Read the first five, then anything by Dan Abnett or Graham McNeill.\" The story as a whole is a compelling one, a story of betrayal and the perception of \"the truth.\" But, Dan Abnett takes it to a whole other sphere with Saturnine. Essentially, the book is about a battle on four different fronts. But it's the nuance of the book that makes it marvelous. Each front is handled in a different style, from a different perspective, as not to make it a bunch of \"bolter porn.\" The prose is excellent as is typical of Abnett. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, especially anyone who is already invested in the Horus Heresy series.**Mild Spoilers**To anyone who has been reading this series, this book takes the time to answer a few questions as to the Emperor's origins and back story AND how and why the primarchs were created and more interestingly, scattered across the galaxy. This nugget is worth the price of admission alone.",

BL seems to have an agenda of pushing out over priced short novels filled with garbage the last few years. The siege of terra books though have been enjoyable and remind me of the first novels from back in the day. Dan Abnett is always a great storyteller. The Seige of Twrra series are thick books, nice action, enjoyable characters and for once some of the traitor characters are getting what they deserve instead of steam rolling over the loyalists with impunity.

        "reviewDescription": "... that my wife got an unprompted reading of my favourite bits.And here's why.The core of the book is a series of scenes that bounce between multiple fronts in the siege of Terra. Each could have been stretched out into a really good novel (with one exception that I'll get to). Each has a great set up, character description and development, and a pay off that makes each story into something meaningful both within the book and more broadly in the series. All the old characters fit with their characterisation in earlier series novels and the development therein. Each of the new characters is interesting and acts like an actual human/superhuman.And there are sufficient surprises that make sense in context of what's gone before that you feel good recognising why X happened even if you didn't see it coming. Over the top of that there is a set of overarching narratives about the way victories in one place require sacrifice in another, and the impact that has on decision makers, how faith can motivate, and how legends are created. It also gives the Imperium a chance to kick through a lot of plot armour that's been getting wearing...That level of writing cohesion is rare. Dan Abnett knows his stuff but this is (IMHO) one of his best.But here's the thing. There are a couple of bits of this book which feel to me a little undercooked, there's a character in it who I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with, and that varies by how much exposition and historical reference he spouts. It's too far the wrong way for me here, echoes of the old Star Child/Sensei narratives...That character's sections feel like set up without meaningful resolution and that leaves the lore dumps a little orphaned... I'd diagnose 'hero from another story' syndrome here and maybe those sections would have been a great short story rather than shoehorned in here. I'd normally knock a five star down to a four star for something like that.Yet I'm still rating this a solid 5 stars. And I'm still reading bits out to my wife. And the undercooked section is still pretty good. And that's what gets me. There is writing here that's so good it could probably be dropped into a three star story and still make it jump to a five. I'd also add that if you haven't got a background in this series it might be a little confusing but that's like bashing a romance for having a 'happily ever after'.Great book. Read it.So that's it.",

Of course it does. So is the whole series. One of my fave series and one of my fave authors because this series is a delight, with great characters who have a great banter-fest throughout all the books, this being no exception. Each book has a different plot and the conflicts get resolved before the end of the book, much like the old sitcoms; except in this one, you know the plot will take a couple more books to resolve.And, Chaney starts this book with diatribe about the evils of social media. Right on! I think social media will be  (already is) the downfall of our democracy. My dad said t.v. would be the downfall of our democracy. He was only off by 50 or 60 years and one type of media wrong. Not bad for a WWII vet! Enjoy...",

        "reviewDescription": "Well I liked the first book but it went downhill--more and more duplication.  Find bad guys.  Get in a scrape.  Shoot with new weapon.  Kill everybody.  <sigh>  And the light-heartedness of the crew is fine, but they say THE SAME THING to each other.  In some ways, it's hard to imagine how I got attached to some of the characters.  But I did as you might guess since I have bought all the books and also what I say in the next paragraph.But this one was different.  Some of all of the above, but the storyline was quite different and more personal to our hero.  And at the end (someone else said something similar)--the wedding.  I thought it was good writing and especially the speech at the end (I won't reveal more, except to say that it was a surprise).",

One was from the last adventure an AI group and it is revealed who created them in this adventure. Another is a very paranoid  species with the brains in their shoulders and the head located in the chest, and yet another is a sentient plant that takes over  another sentient host as a parasite. There is humor, horror, and drama, as well as laughter and the feeling of family. I most definitely recommend this book and the entire series.",

We eventually discover that there's a war going on that is confusing in that there is different against same and same against same.  It's difficult to figure the basis of the fight until we realize that there's an infecting parasite, that originated on a planet populated by people that look like humans.  The fight is between infected and uninfected, and our looks don't make it easy for us to communicate with either side. When we get it all figured out, we establish a plan and save the day.  I guess we don't make the page count for a book so we get a bonus of a second unrelated story where we discover another artifact attached to a wooden sailing ship floating in orbit around a planet.",

BraySeries: Expeditionary Force, Book 3This continues the great fun and adventures of Skippy and Joe as they travel the universe again. This time they are cleverly saving the people on Paradise. It is always a lot of crazy situations, lots of humor, and great banter between the team. Lots of action, adventure, and suspense thrown in there too. I truly love this series. Of course I have to listen to the series so I can hear RC Bray do the voices that really make the story POP!!! I enjoy it so much more with the narration. He is awesomeness! This is my favorite sci-fi soap opera series!!!",

        "reviewDescription": "Paradise, the third book in the Expeditionary Force series, is every bit as enjoyable as the first two. The banter between Col./Sgt Joe and Skippy is witty and endlessly entertaining. I envy Craig Alanson's inventiveness in being able to craft these stories, although I think that his greatest inspiration was to introduce Skippy in 'Columbus Day' as a 'deus ex machina' device. That's when the whole tone of the narrative changed (for the better). Since then, Skippy's prime purpose has been to fulfill that role, but in a most enjoyable way. And there's much more to come. According to Mr. Alanson, he has planned for the series to consist of 12 books, and has even written the last two chapters of the twelfth and final book so that he knows where he's going with the overall narrative. At least that's what he says - speaking as a sometime writer myself, I know trying to nail it down so far ahead can be overly ambitious. Characters tend to take on a life of their own and may refuse to toe the line when it comes to being shoe-horned into those final two chapters. I would like to give 'Paradise' five stars but sadly need to deduct one because of the ongoing lack of good proof-reading that has dogged all three books so far.",

After all, it is the third book in the series.Did you like the first two?  If no then I'm not sure what to say to you, other than you won't like this.  If you did like the first two, then you'll like this one.  Probably a bit more actually, as it's pretty similar but the writing has improved.  Same fun characters (plus some new one's), same creative use of science, and answers to some plot threads that have been dangling unanswered since the first book.  It's a very enjoyable read, and is one of the few military sci-fi novels that actually gets military culture and humor.",

The narration is so good, when I read the book, Skippy‘s voice is in my head. My brother recommended this series to me and is actually rereading it right now. That’s the better review, with all the content out there, to want to read a book series twice means it better be really well written.",

        "reviewDescription": "If you haven't read books 1 (Columbus Day) and 2 (SpecOps), you should read them first to get the proper background leading up to Paradise. The book is well written, but....  The main character is an Army Corporal who goes off to fight on another planet and discovers things aren't as they seem. He is promoted to Sargeant, although he doesn't feel he's ready. Events progress and he finds himself suddenly promoted (by the alien patrons for whom he is fighting) to full Colonel. Yep, E-5 buck Sgt all the way to O-6 bird Colonel. So now he's moved from nominally-qualified Sgt to totally-out-of-his-depth Col. He constantly second-guesses his decisions, and is in the uncomfortable position of commanding the people who he saluted just the day before. But that's just the beginning of his troubles: he finds an acid-tongued, disdainful, insulting Artificial Intelligence in a beer can sized metal capsule who considers humans to be lower than the monkeys he constantly compares them to. Not only is Skippy (the name our hero chose to call the AI) a couple of million years old, he has all the digital data ever recorded in all the data banks in the whole universe in his memory banks, he speaks every language in the universe, and can hold separate conversations with every human on earth simultaneously, while playing chess at the same time. So, if you're out there in space trying to save the world from 4 different alien species with superior firepower and intellect, it's dang convenient to have such a superior problem-solver on your side. I grew very tired of the constant insults, arrogant comments, and constant embarrassments visited upon the human crew (especially on the hero of the story) by the A-I, and found his omnipotence to be unbelievable and intensely irritating. However, the final straw for me is the ending of the story. One of the important things I learned from my 20+ years of military service: like the US Marines and other services SpecOps believe - You do not leave any of your people behind. Everyone goes home....",

    "bookDescription": "Awash with conflict and a building war, the known stars align against Van and his wing of the Guild in a fight for the ultimate control.But Van and his crew suspect there’s more to the Equal Grasp than just a band of thieves, and they begin their campaign at Bopul Station, a lonely outpost where corruption rules and Peacemakers are feared. To continue the fight, and the case, the crew and friends need more than just contacts.They need money.To that end, Van begins exploring an old mystery about his grandfather, which leads to the shocking discovery—the Earth is being stripped of her history, one object at a time, but that’s not the main purpose of the criminals.For their goals are bigger than just stealing art. Much bigger. One of their targets is nothing less than the end of the Fafnir, and Van, and everything he represents.Along the way, Icky learns about motherhood, and Funboy learns about grief, and everyone agrees that cheese is good and pants are bad—--sort of.There’s a time and place for everything. And Van will lead his crew for as long as he can.If he can stay alive. And that’s a pretty big if.",

Bouncing back and forth between Earth and deep space, being played the majority of the time by individual(s) who were just a step ahead of him. Frustrating, as Van could never quite see his next move. An excellent book, characters shine like never before and that is saying a lot. It finally takes the unthinkable, but Van sees the path he and the crew of the Fafnir are ready to do the unthinkable. Highly recommend.",

        "reviewDescription": "Wow! This was a doozy!! So many things happen in this book. I’m still reeling.😳I simply love ❤️this series! Even at book 20 these two authors bring new adventures, action, subterfuge, drama and so much more. It’s really rather amazing! But… one of their very really gifts is how they bring the characters and the story to life, even making it feel current (if we really had aliens and a police force from space landing on Earth, that is 😉)😂  If you’re new to this series, looking at whether you want to read this book? I’d say do it because it’s really great, but what I’d really suggest (with sincerity exclamation points) is starting at book 1. This one has a ton happening in reaction to many of the things that have occurred throughout the books, so you’d miss out on all that backstory and build up to this book and that would just be a tragedy, a missed opportunity of untold entertainment. The beginning is usually the best place to start, anyways, but especially with this series. It’s a stack of stories—one adding to the next, & introductions of the characters, their lives, relationships and all the dramatics of the storylines. Hopefully you’ll start while on vacation because you won’t want to stop until you’ve reached the latest release.  Guaranteed!Enjoy!👍😉I can’t wait for book 21, bring the wrath!!",

    "bookDescription": "Thawed out after a century of cryogenic sleep, Captain John “Black Jack” Geary has led the Alliance fleet through Syndicate Worlds space, thwarting the enemy at every turn—even within his own ranks—during the long journey home.\nAlliance prisoners of war are being held at a labor camp in the Heradao Star System, which also happens to be the location of the majority of the surviving Syndic warships. Determined not to leave any of his people behind, Black Jack Geary orders the fleet to strike hard and fast to rescue the POWs with minimal Alliance losses.\nThe raid is successful, but victory is short-lived. Geary discovers that the Syndics plan to ambush the fleet with their powerful reserve flotilla in an attempt to annihilate it once and for all—but he doesn’t know where the enemy is located.\nAnd as Geary has the fleet jump from one star system to the next, hoping to avoid the inevitable confrontation, saboteurs contribute to the chaos …",

        "reviewDescription": "Book number five of a six book military science fiction series.  Plus several sequel series consisting of fourteen books total.  I read the well printed and well bound MMPB published by Ace in 2009 that I bought on Amazon.  I have purchased the sequel book in this series and plan to read it soon.I did not know John G. Hemry was the real name for Jack Campbell as I purchased the Stark series quite a while back and enjoyed it also.The Alliance sent a war fleet into the Syndic home star system via the new FTL network to defeat the Syndics once and for all.  However, the Syndics knew that they were coming and destroyed many of the Alliance space warships.  Now the Alliance warships need to leave or be destroyed one by one.The Alliance admiral left Captain John “Black Jack” Geary in charge of the Alliance fleet before he and his staff were murdered by the Syndics in the negotiations.  Captain John “Black Jack” Geary was found by the Alliance fleet on their way to Syndic space, in stasis in an old emergency pod.  A hundred year old emergency pod.  Captain John “Black Jack” Geary may be a hundred years out of date but some things like tactics of war spaceship fleets never go away.Captain Geary is leading his fleet of warships and supply ships through old wormholes, trying to anticipate Syndic attacks and gather raw materials and feed his crews.  Moving into the Heradoa star system, they find a huge POW camp that they must liberate even though they are rapidly running out of food and fuel.",

        "reviewTitle": "Riveting Naval Military Science Fiction",
        "reviewDescription": "Relentless (Book #5) picks up right where Valiant (Book #4) leaves off in the Lost Fleet series by Jack Campbell. The fleet is still under the command of Captain John \"Black Jack\" Geary, and they are still trying to head for home. The Fleet is also still under attack from internal sources trying to assassinate Geary to force a return to the way things used to be, before he took command. The assassination and betrayal-from-within subplot comes to a major peak in this book.In this book, we get a lot more up-close and personal interaction with the Marines, who we follow for decent lengths of time as they liberate a POW camp. We also see the culmination of the fears Geary has had about the gates, and the suspected aliens, leading to an intense finale and ultimate showdown as the alliance approaches the borders of their home territory.The Lost Fleet series is one of my favorite Military Science Fiction series, and frankly, it is one of my favorite series, period. It is a story told in the grand tradition of Star Trek/Star Wars and epic space operas in general. The Lost Fleet series is what got me majorly hooked on Military Science Fiction, which lead to me discovering other excellent series after that, such as the Man of War by Honsinger, and the Frontlines series by Kloos, and the Shadowstorm series by Almasi. Read it, you won't be disappointed.5 stars.---------------------------------Book Content Guide For Parents:---------------------------------Sex & Nudity: [1/5] sex is discussed in the book but not described, and it is all past-tense.Violence & Gore: [2.5/5] fairly minimal-- almost all of the story takes place aboard the space ships, so any violence is via naval space battles, which do result in the deaths of people, but they are never described, so feel very abstract. However, we stay with the Marines a lot more in this one, and some of the battle field wounds, and fighting is covered when that happens, so the violence bumps up a bit in this one.Profanity: [1/5] minimal, not nearly as much or as often as you might expect from a military science fiction story.Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking: [1/5] minimal. No smoking or drug use, and only minor alcohol use.Frightening/Intense Scenes: [2/5] the ships and crew are in mortal danger pretty much all of the time while behind enemy lines but nothing like a character being chased down a dark hallway followed by a homicidal maniac. There is a scene where a character commits suicide, but it is describe in abstract terms, and is bloodless to the reader.",

        "reviewTitle": "Gathering the threads",
        "reviewDescription": "Here's my bias: I love these books.This book is especially interesting because it gathers up so many of the threads that have appeared through the previous books and starts the process of weaving them together into what is sure to be a rousing final novel. Reading it immediately on the heels of the first four, and knowing it will be many months before the sixth book is published, I found this book to be more complex than the earliest books in the series.This is not in any way a stand-alone book. Most of the important events are small shifts, or mini-resolutions of previous issues which still leave questions hanging. The key relationships in this book are difficult to parse without knowing what happened in the previous books.Having said that, I need to say that I found this book quite good. The characters progressed, which is one of the great things about this series. People grow in response to their experiences, and the growth is not always in directions they expected or wanted. Some of the relationships are complex, and not everyone navigates those complexities with ease or finesse. The characters have very human flaws, even the \"good guys\", and the \"bad guys\" are largely believable in both their motivations and their actions.The premise of a long-dead hero returning to lead a fleet home from a devastating defeat in a navy which has changed (and not for the better) in his absence remains intriguing, even while the focus of the action shifts from the war between the two human factions to consideration of larger threats. I'm expecting a rip-roaring finale to this series, based on the quality of the first five books.Start with Dauntless (The Lost Fleet, Book 1) and work your way to this one. There's much to love in these books, and a rollicking good time to be had if you are just reading them for the plot. Be aware, however, that like many penultimate volumes in planned series, this fifth one is largely about gathering the plotlines together and setting them up for that (still forthcoming) resolution.",

        "reviewTitle": "Na endlich, Black Jack gibt Gas!",
        "reviewDescription": "Wie in meiner Rezension des vierten Bandes \"Valiant\" angekündigt bzw. erhofft, starten Jack Campbell und sein Protagonist Captain John \"Black Jack\" Geary endlich durch.Fantastische, für unmöglich gehaltene Triumphe hat der als Retter der Allianz prophezeite Held John Geary gegen die Syndics gefeiert. Gegen alle Wahrscheinlichkeiten hat er die hoffnunglos in einer Falle sitzende Flotte der Allianz gerettet und mit ungewöhnlichen Taktiken die Flucht kreuz und quer durch das Syndic Gebiet gewagt. Zahlreiche Verluste musste der Feind hinnehmen und die Legende des eines Tages zurückkehrenden Überhelden Geary wird zum Albtraum für den Feind....Doch die lange Flucht zehrt an der Flotte und ihrem Kommandanten. Viele Schiffe wurden trotz der überwältigenden Siege zerstört. Die Wartungs- und Produktionskapazitäten der Flotte kommen mit der Produktion von Treibstoff, Raketen und Ersatzteilen nicht mehr nach. Die Essensvorräte werden knapp.Doch mit vereinten Kräften zieht die Flotte in ihre letzten Schlachten. Denn ohne Nachschub muss die Flotte dringend zurück in das heimatliche Allianz Gebiet. Auf dem Weg liegt Heradao, ein Sternensystem in dem Kriegsgefangene von den Syndics festgehalten werden. Und Heradao liegt auf dem Weg nach Hause.....Das alte Muster der Bände 2 bis 3 der Lost Fleet-Reihe zieht sich zwar fort, aber das Ende der Odysee ist in Sicht. Dadurch nimmt die Geschwindigkeit der Entwicklungen und auch die Spannung nochmals zu, was wir in Band 4 schon wohlwollend zur Kenntnis genommen haben. Somit liest sich der vorliegende Band Fünf enorm flüssig, wir fiebern wieder mit, und der Autor hat noch die eine oder andere kleine Überraschung für uns auf Lager.Mit dem vorliegenden Band biegen Jack Campbell und sein Held endgültig in die Zielgerade der Lost Fleet-Reihe ein. Das tut dem Leser und Fan sehr, sehr gut, da weitere 300 Seiten Selbstzweifel und Herumgeirre jede Lust an dieser Saga abgetötet hätten.So aber freuen wir uns auf einen fulminanten sechsten Band, der angeblich den Abschluss dieser Reihe bilden soll. Da sich der Autor recht dispzipliniert um die 320 Seiten je Band bewegt, stellt sich tatsächlich die Frage, wie alle offenen Handlungsstränge zufriedenstellend in einem einzigen Band abgehandelt werden sollen. Mal sehen.....Fazit: Black Jack kehrt im wahrsten Sinne wieder zurück und erkämpft sich knapp aber doch fünf Sterne!",

Van and his crew are pressed just keep up with everything that is happening, which is basically everything that he has been trying to accomplish in the previous seven books coming to a head in this one. Great writing, dialogue and characters as always are fantastic, and the story moves at a blistering pace. As always, Van has the challenge of figuring out who he can trust, both inside and outside the Peacemaker Guild; and now add in the Knights, things just get more difficult. A lot of great action in this one, and the ending for 'Blackest Ocean' is way over the top. Superb, highly recommend this series.",

Slight hints towards the end of the book, but it basically continues the same cliff hanger over to the next book.Well written story, which makes this even more frustrating. And unnecessary. If they didn't want to clear up the cliff hanger in this book, there was no need for the ending of the previous book. Just roll that into this book or leave it out.It makes me as a reader nervous that they will keep doing this and instead of a decent wrap up at the end of each book, just give us a tease which they do nothing about in the following book.",

        "reviewDescription": "Blackest Ocean is book 8 of a 12 book series, and the first I've given a five star rating.  I've taken the time to review most of them, but I see now that I've been doing it wrong.I've been trying to review them as individual books, rather than as one single narrative.  This was wrong.  I need to take a step back from each individual book and consider it as one story.  One EPIC story.The series is full of action. Lots of combat and battle. But it's not repetitive, they don't just grind through, going from one battle to the next.  Van and the crew of the Fafnir win battles with creativity and courage rather than with just muscle and brawn.The series is full of humor. This is what I love the most in a book, clever word play. My favorite books are the ones who make me laugh out loud. And I get that here, over and over again.The series takes place in alien worlds. Yeah, there are humans everywhere, but they play a minimal role. They're there to help us see that space is big (thanks Perry) but humans have a place in it. Meanwhile we have aliens that are alien. They're not just quaint, oddly shaped humans. Spock, for all his Vulcan heritage, was always, inside, human.The series is about respect.  Deep down that is the message I get.  Everyone has individual value which must be respected.And, finally, the series is one complete story. And because it is so big it takes forever for some details to come out. I used to get frustrated because Van never seemed to ask questions about his family, his past. But why would he? These were things he just accepted. Why would he ask questions he thought he knew the answer to? So now, here in book 8, two thirds of the way through, we start to get the big picture.And so we need to take yet another step back so we can better see it.I am so glad that I happened to stumble across the Backyard Spaceship. It has been so much fun.",

        "reviewDescription": "There seems to always be a loose end leading to a bigger battle than the one before.Don't get me wrong, a few of my favorite series, reread many times, were space operas.  Reminiscent of black and white short movie serials shown mixed in with cartoons before the main feature on kids summer movie days Sci-Fi space opera doesn't always end with a cliffhanger but you still know there is more to come.The Backyard Starship series is part detective, part frontier Marshall justice, part aliens and spaceships, mixed with low brow humor. All family friendly.The basic theme of good versus evil is dosed with questions of Artificial Intelligence sentient with rights or not, and so much else reflecting many of the problems humanity faces here on earth.A fun series to read and to see ourselves without heavy slap to the face commentary often seen in sci-fi dystopian movies and writings.Enjoy",

    "bookDescription": "The New York Times bestselling series based on the blockbuster Xbox® games continues with the acclaimed story of Spartan Edward Buck—first seen in HALO: ODST and reappearing in HALO 5: GUARDIANS!While Spartans get all the glory, no soldier―not even the legendary Master Chief―wins a war on his own. Gunnery Sergeant Edward Buck and his team of Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODSTs) played a major role in saving Earth from all-out invasion at the end of the Covenant War―acts of bravery and ingenuity that did not go unnoticed by the United Nations Space Command. Now, after many Spartans have been killed in battle and the Master Chief is listed as MIA, the UNSC decides to create a new generation of Spartans to defend humanity from threats both outside―and within. When they come to Buck with an extraordinary proposition, he is forced to make a life-altering decision. With the Covenant War finally over, is it time for him to retire to the sidelines for a life he could only dream about…or is he prepared to step up and become part of the military’s new blood?

        "reviewTitle": "This should have been the bridge-book between Halo 3 and Halo 4.",
        "reviewDescription": "Halo is the franchise that turned me into a hardcore gamer, and Eric Nylund's Halo novels are a very large part of what turned me into an avid reader (sorry Harry Potter). They added depth and character to a universe I already loved, and told stories that were just as exciting as the video games they bridged together.Which makes me wonder, why wasn't THIS book the official bridge between Halo 3 and Halo 4? Karen Traviss's Kilo Five trilogy may have much more substantial links to Halo 4 as far as direct backstory is concerned, but Halo: New Blood does an infinitely better job of setting up the new state of the galaxy in general, and the Spartan-IV program specifically. Halo: New Blood actually FEELS like Halo, and not a sluggish and boring political science thesis like the Kilo Five trilogy did.New Blood also does an excellent job of expanding on the character of Gunnery Sergeant Edward Buck, the fan-favorite ODST played by Nathan Fillion in the games. Not only do we find out what he and the rest of the characters of Halo 3: ODST have been doing since that game, we also get to see his entire backstory with glimpses of his childhood, early career as an ODST (Orbital Drop Shock Trooper), and how he first met ONI Captain Veronica Dare. And perhaps the best aspect of this is that Matt Forbeck manages to capture the character of Buck so well that I actually found myself reading this book in Nathan Fillion's voice inside my head. To my knowledge, this is the first Halo novel that has been written in first-person, and using a major game character as that narrator on top of it.This first-person perspective makes it much easier to handle the fact that this novel does not tell a linear narrative. Rather, it reads as more of a stream-of-consciousness piece, as if Buck is actually sitting down with you and telling you this story in person. It makes the reading fun, but also a bit frustrating as some important scenes cut away to different ones that take place years in the past. As I said, the first-person narration makes these jumps easy to follow, but those looking for a linear narrative will not find one here.In the end, Halo: New Blood is the best Halo book since Eric Nylund's Halo: First Strike, and I hope Matt Forbeck writes another one.",

        "reviewDescription": "Gunny Sargent Edward Buck was a superior soldier in every way. He was an ODST, Orbital Drop Shock Trooper, that was a great team leader and a tactician and a fighter. He lead his troups through some of the worst fighting in the war against the Covenant and has seen things and done things that even shocked himself. He was proud of his team's accomplishments and what they had done in the war effort to help defend and save the human race from destruction at the hand of the Covenant races they fought against.As the end of the Covenant War came there was still a lot of things to accomplish to make humanity safe. Clean out the rebel Covenant soldiers and the just as dangerous human rebel soldiers that immediately rose up from the ashes and began fighting the UNSC in an effort to declare independence from Earth.  Buck accepts a promotion to become a Spartan IV warrior. A super human trained to the peak of military fighting. He soon finds out that all is not well in the Spartan ranks as it appears that there is a traitor in the Spartan training camp......I have read almost all of the Halo books and I have enjoyed many of them.  This one is a great story for me. As it openly discussed the fighting that Edward Buck and his teams went through and his transition to becoming a Spartan IV. I like the book a lot and I rated it at 5 stars. Military Sci-Fi is my favorite genre and this book fit into the style of story that I enjoy the most.",

        "reviewDescription": "Great story. Reintroduces familiar characters and gives you an update on what they've been up to. It also gives you a recap of Halo ODST so if you haven't played that it's not a big deal. Overall I enjoyed it a lot. It's also not very long but it keeps it from dragging.",

The Cridal Premier, Seeladas Dalton, had been replaced by a cybernetic imposter and now Jacob has discovered that the deception goes much deeper.

One with an AI that needed a crew so it could pass itself off as a non-AI ship.\nHaving survived their first adventure in space, they now had a new, larger, and much faster ship. Returning to Earth should have been the easy part.\nThey also had a wedding to plan.\nUnfortunately, nothing goes as planned.\nThey are sent to a new destination in space to meet with a new alien species, with whom the other aliens' first contact didn't go very smoothly.\nAlong the way, they stumble across a new artifact, something ancient and possibly more dangerous than anything they have encountered.\nWhat do you do with a piece of technology that can upset the balance of power in the galaxy?",

        "reviewDescription": "Adrian Tchaikovsky (not the original spelling of his name) is a real writer.  Not like the trash sci fi clone producers we have all guiltily consumed — “Its like Heinlein’s ‘Have spacesuit will travel, but, …..well actually it is like a cheap copy of Heinlein, to be honest, but it was exactly that. Cheap!”  Tchaikovsky is a novelist.  An award winning novelist and this series — read the whole thing — shows him at his peak.  He creates characters you care about, people you do not want to let go when you leave the book.  There are little Easter eggs in the prose throughout.  Lines you look at and think ‘he must have had fun writing that sentence!’  His world-building is excellent. The book has action, humor, tragedy, triumph.  ‘What more do you want?  A homicidal, deified claim?  OK.  I’ll add one of those.’ [Not spoiler alert — It’s there.). ‘With a razor and tentacles!’  ‘Natch’  ‘And a mechanical major d’omo?’  ‘What do you think we are here?  Pikers?  Of course!’]  You could quibble. Any novelist that invents an entirely different *domain*, a reality whose laws are not our own, is so unconstrained that their art is lessened.  The scenes in non space are the weakest ones in the book.  Ok.  Maybe.  But in this case the author keeps it within bounds. Highly recommended",

        "reviewDescription": "This is an excellent series, with superb universe-building, well-crafted characters and a solid plot from start to finish. This we have come to expect from Adrian Tchaikovsky, and in The Final Architecture, he delivers.The final book of the trilogy takes place a bit after the conclusion of its middle novel, and it begins with the major factions in the first two books in an uneasy detente. All are working to figure out how to stop the Architects from remodeling populated planets by taking the fight them in \"unspace.\"  Or are they?Not all is at is seems at the surface, and eventually, an unholy alliance is formed, upsetting the balance of power. The crew of the Vulture God, the spy for Hugh and the self-anointed aliens - the Essiel -  are of course, in the middle of all of the events. Without dropping any spoilers, the book ties up almost every loose thread, wraps up the story and left me thinking about what I'd read for quite a while after I finished it.Tchaikovsky could write another three trilogies in the Architecture universe. It's a fascinating and unique place he's created, with artificial life rather reminiscent of honeybees, a utopian sect of genetically engineered warriors, unfathomable aliens and humanity frayed well past the point one would expect it to shatter into oblivion. Then there is unspace -- dimensions outside of reality that drive almost everyone insane shortly after entry. These are not cliche tropes, even if we've encountered something like them in other novels through the years. There surely are a lot more stories there, and if Adrian Tchaikovsky ever decides to write them, I'll happily read them when they're released.",

Everybody that is except Idris Telemmier who wants to destroy the entities that are controlling the Architects.  But just when the plans to destroy the Architects is about to happen factions opposing this plan unite and attempt to take over the Eye.The ideas and concepts in this book are truly fascinating.  Combine this with great action scenes and indelible characters and you have all the elements you need to tell a fascinating story.

I really wanted to know more about the main characters' journeys, about what fate (or fates!) the universe was going to face. The author's characterisation is so powerful, so convincing, his universe-building (and unbuilding) so compelling. There is an accumulation of details, of backstories, of hints and references which never drag at the reader's enjoyment of the breakneck pacing, the breathless rush of the plot. Nothing is thrown away. Details are not just noise or fillers, nor are they captions or didactic exposition. The shifting, and sometimes concurrent, narrative perspectives are not there to dazzle or bludgeon. They add energy and empathy. They anchor the sprawling, cosmos-spanning action, reminding us that in the end, even against the crushing, incomprehensible odds hurled at us by a universe that does not care, what really matters are people, individually and collectively. Our choices, our failures, our struggles, our impulse and conviction to just be. I need to come down from the high the book has given me, let a little time pass by, and then I think I'll re-read the whole trilogy!",

They picked up three species on this adventure and one was still an egg. The main characters exhibit intelligence, humility, mercy, and no tolerance for one species lording it over another, let alone tolerate different castes of a species lording it over their workers. That is exactly how they should be, very commendable story telling. We need more of that reality in our own world. The plot is easily followed and the premise generally is trying to find the Creators of the AI workers who are building portals to reach the Creators. I highly recommend this book and the entire series.",

        "reviewDescription": "[How I wish I could do a minimal review.]This series of Artifact books is extremely well conceived and written, so much so that I was able to ignore any punctuation or spelling errors which usually bring my OCD mind up short.The main characters, Ben and Mark, and their fellow travelers, are almost like Star Trek - the original - characters in that they want to go where no one has gone before, and help those they find. The Mee character is their alter ego who will crack the whip, if necessary. But \"She who must not be offended\" has a heart, or two, of gold and only uses her death ray for good.IMHO, this series is an allegory for what's happening in the USA in 2025, with a wannabee tyrant and, by the end of Book Seven, the hoped for outcome is what many here hope for.I've said too much except - this is a genuine movie of the mind series and I was pleased to see there will be a chapter 8.Enjoy; I truly did!",

    "bookDescription": "Vicious interstellar conflict with an indestructible alien species. Bloody civil war over the last habitable zones of the cosmos. Political unrest, militaristic police forces, dire threats to the Solar System…\nHumanity is on the ropes, and after years of fighting a two-front war with losing odds, so is North American Defense Corps officer Andrew Grayson. He dreams of dropping out of the service one day, alongside his pilot girlfriend, but as warfare consumes entire planets and conditions on Earth deteriorate, he wonders if there will be anywhere left for them to go.\nAfter surviving a disastrous space-borne assault, Grayson is reassigned to a ship bound for a distant colony—and packed with malcontents and troublemakers. His most dangerous battle has just begun.\nIn this sequel to the bestselling Terms of Enlistment, a weary soldier must fight to prevent the downfall of his species…or bear witness to humanity’s last, fleeting breaths.",

        "reviewDescription": "Returning to the fascinating universe he's created, the second novel by Marko Kloos is entirely solid follow-up to his first novel Terms of Enlistment.When we pick up with the main character five years after the events of the previous novel, things have gone even further downhill for humanity. Now the North American Commonwealth military, the one last bastion of order and stability, is feeling the civilization toppling strain of vastly overpopulated Earth, and having to fight two wars; one against the still very alien 'Lankies', 80ft tall quadrupeds with superior technology, and the antagonistic forces of the Sino-Russian Alliance (a ill-defined nation made up of Russia and China). Gone is the feeling of superiority, replaced with a feeling of desperation as the NAC military is stretched to the breaking point.The story does an admirable job at depicting life in the NAC military as it appears to be the only thing standing in the way of a complete collapse of the entire western hemisphere. IT also, surprisingly, allows us to see beyond the gritty urban sprawls of the rioting welfare cities of Earth, of how the 'middle class' of this new world lives in a sequence that honestly made me tear up a little.But then as soon as it's over we're back to the war. And unfortunately, this war isn't as interesting as it appears to be on the surface. Once again I have to give the highest praise to Kloos for using his own combat experience for creating scenarios that feel realistic, but at the same time once again suffer from an over-use of military jargon. As much as I tried, I found the combat sequences to just be a bit tiring and dragging on for too long.His issues with the characters still have yet to change, as outside of the larger handful of characters that we're supposed to care about, there's a dozen more than serve no purpose and take up space on the page. My suspension of disbelief was also strained as the main protagonist continues to defy massive odds and survive against both the SRA and the Lanky aliens, who lose some of their exoticness within this novel (though still remain as alien as ever). There's also the case that the main character has the greatest luck in the universe, surviving things that otherwise murdered everyone around him or hooking up with highly important characters both new and returning almost by chance. Most of the time, it's fine and that's what a protagonist does, but it all seemed just a tiny bit too convenient.The primary conflict that dominates the back half of the book drags on for far too long, and while well written using his experience, Mr. Kloos still lacks enough descriptive skill for me to really tell what is shooting at what. I wasn't even aware that the starships in this universe were bound to physics until this book started mentioning that they had to perform a very The Expanse like mode of deceleration via flipping a starship and retro-burning to slow down enough get anywhere.But all in all, despite the same general issues that I had with the previous book and a lack of general interest in the primary conflict, Lines of Departure is still an excellent read and I highly recommend it.",

        "reviewDescription": "I like Sci-Fi but it's not the main genre that I'm typically drawn to.  I prefer reading action-oriented stories about characters that I can relate to, supported by a good writing style.  This book has that (as does the other two books in this series).  The author's writing style is so good that at times I felt like I was listening to an old friend telling me a story instead of reading it on my kindle.The author has a simplistic writing style that gives you just enough detail to understand what's going on without boring you to death.  This style keeps the story moving and allows the author to draw parallels to current events without spending dozens of pages giving the back story.  The net affect of this is that it keeps the reader engaged.The story is told from the perspective of the main character and it follows his life as a soldier: the adventures he embarks on with every new posting and it's impact on him and his life outside of the military.  The author does a great job of frequently explaining the technical aspect of the futuristic military hardware and how it functions to enhance the efficiency of the soldier (this was really cool!).  There's also a bit of romance in here too (building on \"Terms of Enlistment\") that the author handles well and with levity.I was happy that this book was longer than the author's past books because it meant that I could spend more time hanging out with Andrew Grayson.  All in all, a good read.This book is a sequel, so you'll want to read \"Terms of Enlistment\" first.  You can also read \"Measures of Absolution\" and \"Lucky Thirteen\" after you read \"Terms of Enlistment\" as they are short stories about characters introduced in \"Terms of Enlistment\".",

Lots of aliens.Specifically, lots of alien males all who want one thing from her - for her to choose them as her mate. Maise has to adapt to a strange situation on an alien homeworld where she is being kept and courted, given her choice of steamy alien men to choose from. It’s an alien dating game where she makes all the choices. The only problem is that she wants a man who chooses her.Can she find the right type of alphahole who can also be the kind of man to give her everything she ever wanted?Lucky for her, one doesn’t find an alphahole.Alphaholes find you.Please note: This novelette has a LOT of adult language, steamy knotty romance, boundary exploration, tight spaces and a healthy dose of consent, communication, miscommunication, and respect. If you are offended by unusual women, alien physiology, or quick steamy romance I doubt you would have even made it past the cover and read this far into the description, so please enjoy. This is a continuation of the original Cryo Crisis 10 book series. It can be read as a stand alone and any of the books can be read in any order.",

It was a light, fun, low drama romance between people from different cultures who were willing to hear each other out. I appreciated the MMC being willing to give up misguided (sometimes funny) tactics to win the FMC, and her willingness to move on past his mistakes.I also liked that there was respect given to the fact that having the equipment doesn't mean you are required or expected to want a baby! As someone who experienced a similar background in some ways to the FMC, it was nice that she had the maturity to get why having children is not always wise to do, or something to rush into.If you dislike adult language, I don't recall much of that in this book. If you don't like explicit intimate scenes, you may want to skip this one. Otherwise, enjoy this lounging in the sun with some shades and a nice beverage.",

His study guide on human mating rituals had me laughing so hard my sides hurt. The world- building was imaginative and the characters were likable. I would read another book based in this world.",

This whole series offers a good variety of personalities, and I loved the pairing of Sierra as her buddy simply because they are so different.

But he views his mission as both a duty and an opportunity to make things better wherever he can. And when a crippled Rift Federation ship tumbles out of jump space, Geary leaps into action. But the survivors' story isn't completely adding up.\nAs Geary investigates, he soon finds himself fending off spies and assassins while leading the fleet as it fights its way across space controlled by the mysterious and hostile aliens whom humans call enigmas. Challenges arrive at every turn, including an unknown alien species that invites the fleet to visit one of their star systems. With little information to go on, Geary must weigh the benefits of potential new allies against the possibility of a trap. The fate of the fleet—and perhaps even the future of humanity—will depend on him making the right decision.\nIf he can stay alive long enough to do that.",

Also waiting for the 5th and6th books ofThe Lost Stars (President Iceni, Gnr Drakon, Kommodors Marphissa & Bradamont) and of course the books of the OUTLANDS after Resolute. Thanks to Jack Campbell. I hope there will be a Galaxy Map showing all allien star systems around Alliance, in the coming books.",
