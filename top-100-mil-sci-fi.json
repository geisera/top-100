  "bookDescription": "Perfect for an entry-level sci-fi listener and the ideal addition to a veteran fan’s collection, John Scalzi's Old Man’s War will take audiences on a heart-stopping adventure into the far corners of the universe.  John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army.  The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce—and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.  Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.  John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine—and what he will become is far stranger.   John Scalzi's Old Man's War is a stunning novel of the long war for human survival—in a universe replete with hostility",

  "bookDescription": "From New York Times bestselling author Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game―adapted to film starring Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford―is the classic Hugo and Nebula award-winning science fiction novel of a young boy's recruitment into the midst of an interstellar war.In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut―young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.THE ENDER UNIVERSEEnder seriesEnder’s Game / Ender in Exile / Speaker for the Dead / Xenocide / Children of the MindEnder’s Shadow seriesEnder’s Shadow / Shadow of the Hegemon / Shadow Puppets / Shadow of the Giant / Shadows in FlightChildren of the FleetThe First Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)Earth Unaware / Earth Afire / Earth AwakensThe Second Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)The Swarm /The HiveEnder novellasA War of Gifts /First Meetings",

It is regarded as one of the greatest military science fiction novels ever written, capturing the alienation that servicemen and women experience even now upon returning home from battle. This book shines a light not only on the culture of the 1970s in which it was written, but also on our potential future. \"To say that The Forever War is the best science fiction war novel ever written is to damn it with faint praise. It is…as fine and woundingly genuine a war story as any I've read\" (William Gibson). This ebook features an illustrated biography of Joe Haldeman including rare images from the author's personal collection",

The force sent to end the Warmaster's rebellion doesn't realise they are heading towards a slaughter unlike anything the galaxy has seen.\nLISTEN TO IT BECAUSE\nIt's the deepest exploration so far of one of the most horrific battles of the Horus Heresy. You may know what happened during the Dropsite Massacre, but you don't know it all. It's far worse than you thought as the treachery is revealed.\nTHE STORY\nHorus has rebelled against the Emperor by purging his and his brother's Legions, but what was supposed to be a secret act of murder has been revealed. In the Emperor's name, Rogal Dorn and Malcador the Sigillite dispatch the largest force of legionaries and primarchs ever assembled to end Horus' rebellion before it can begin.\nBut the loyalists, on their way to enact vengeance, do not know the depth of the betrayal they face. They will not be the perpetrators of a massacre, but its victims. The last hope of returning to the Great Crusade and the unity of the Imperium will die in the dust of Isstvan V, and those who survive will live in a new age of darkness.\nWritten by John French. Narrated by Jonathan Keeble. Runtime 11 hours and 27 minutes approx.",

  "bookDescription": "After a decade, acclaimed science fiction master John Scalzi returns to the galaxy of the Old Man's War series with the long awaited seventh book, The Shattering Peace  THE PEACE IS SHATTERING  For a decade, peace has reigned in interstellar space. A tripartite agreement between the Colonial Union, the Earth, and the alien Conclave has kept the forces of war at bay, even when some would have preferred to return to the fighting and struggle of former times. For now, more sensible heads have prevailed – and have even championed unity.  But now, there is a new force that threatens the hard-maintained peace: The Consu, the most advanced intelligent species humans have ever met, are on the cusp of a species-defining civil war. This war is between Consu factions... but nothing the Consu ever do is just about them. The Colonial Union, the Earth and the Conclave have been unwillingly dragged into the conflict, in the most surprising of ways.  Gretchen Trujillo is a mid-level diplomat, working in an unimportant part of the Colonial Union bureaucracy. But when she is called to take part in a secret mission involving representatives from every powerful faction in space, what she finds there has the chance to redefine the destinies of humans and aliens alike... or destroy them forever.",

This is a time of change; humanity has witnessed the dream of the Emperor’s Great Crusade unravel, and from their perspective, it’s all the fault of the Legions.The Traitor Warmaster is dead. Terra lies in ruins. The Emperor is silent. Amid the rubble of the Palace, shell-shocked survivors emerge into the light of an uncertain dawn. New powers are present now, ones that have travelled the length of the galaxy to bring salvation to the Imperium, though they are as readily cast as usurpers as redeemers. The survivors of Horus’ Grand Armada, now scattered and desperate to escape vengeance, are riven with doubt and dissension, and their gods too are silent. Amid all the grief and confusion, some hopeful souls believe the war to be over and an era of renewal just ahead. But wiser heads know that this war can never end, and that the only question remaining is who shall rise to power within the perilous new age, and who shall fall.",

After exhausting all strategies to keep seething colonial insurrections from exploding into a full-blown interplanetary civil war, the UNSC has one last hope. At the Office of Naval Intelligence, Dr. Catherine Halsey has been hard at work on a top-secret program that could bring an end to the conflict…and it starts with seventy-five children, among them a six-year-old boy named John.

For hundreds of years, the fighters of the Kusanagi Peninsula have held the Empire's enemies at bay, earning their frozen spit of land the name \"The Sword of Kaigen\".\nBorn into Kusanagi's legendary Matsuda family, f14-year-old Mamoru has always known his purpose: To master his family's fighting techniques and defend his homeland. But when an outsider arrives and pulls back the curtain on Kaigen's alleged age of peace, Mamoru realizes that he might not have much time to become the fighter he was bred to be. Worse, the empire he was bred to defend may stand on a foundation of lies.\nMisaki told herself that she left the passions of her youth behind when she married into the Matsuda house. Determined to be a good housewife and mother, she hid away her sword, along with everything from her days as a fighter in a faraway country. But with her growing son asking questions about the outside world, the threat of an impending invasion looming across the sea, and her frigid husband grating on her nerves, Misaki finds the fighter in her clawing its way back to the surface.\nWhen the winds of war reach their peninsula, will the Matsuda family have the strength to defend their empire? Or will they tear each other apart before the true enemies even reach their shores?",

Even more puzzling, the ship is of human construction. As the ship regains functionality, traps left by mutineers threaten the lives of Archer and the tiny crew aboard the derelict.When he succeeds in bringing Defender back to Alliance space, an idealistic scientist posts critical information regarding Defender’s advanced technology. The Nemeans and Scyllans press for peace talks—a delaying tactic while they evaluate the information dump. When they learn that implementation is at least a year away, they break the truce violently, attempting to capture the Alliance and EU delegates during peace talks on Earth.Archer suffers devastating losses in the attack, which he has difficulty processing emotionally. Bette has her own issues of this type, and the two part on uncertain terms. She then disappears, leaving a cryptic note.Defender’s Awakening is a pulse-pounding space opera of interstellar intrigue, moral dilemmas, and fragile emotional bonds.

The owner of a Zeus that has been in his family for generations is in danger of losing this priceless legacy to bureaucratic red tape, and must decide how far he is willing to go to keep it. And the eccentric mercenary commander Alonzo Barrett, a descendant of the ancient Musketeers, seeks to engineer a fateful showdown with the legendary Black Widow herself, but will a legend fall for his gambit?In this issue, you’ll travel to the heart of Mongolia on Christmas evening, 3151, where a Mongolian Cavalier who fought the Clans must join forces with her conquerors in pursuit of a common goal. You’ll follow a close-knit group of young friends in the Magistracy who discovered an abandoned Star League ’Mech and learn that jumping into a ’Mech cockpit isn’t as simple as they imagined. And finally you’ll visit a system abandoned during the fires of the Fourth Succession War, a planet not quite as uninhabited as previously assumed…Protect your birthright and fight for future generations by exploring the melee-centric ’Mechs common in the Rasalhague Dominion, learning some common pitfalls to avoid in ’Mech engineering, and diving into the chivalric societies and MechWarrior cabals of the Federated Suns aristocracy. Then wage a new war with intel from unit and planet digests, technical readouts, playable scenarios, and more!James BixbyWunji LauD. G. P. RectorJonathan HicksJacob W. BrooksJeff KautzChris G.

  "bookDescription": "Red Rising hit the ground running and wasted no time becoming a sensation. Golden Son continues the stunning saga of Darrow, a rebel forged by tragedy, battling to lead his oppressed people to freedom.\nAdapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music!\nAs a Red, Darrow grew up working the mines deep beneath the surface of Mars, enduring backbreaking labor while dreaming of the better future he was building for his descendants. But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow’s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds—and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within.\nA lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love—but also the wrath of powerful rivals. To wage and win the war that will change humankind’s destiny, Darrow must confront the treachery arrayed against him, overcome his all-too-human desire for retribution—and strive not for violent revolt but a hopeful rebirth. Though the road ahead is fraught with danger and deceit, Darrow must choose to follow Eo’s principles of love and justice to free his people.\nHe must live for more.\nPerformed by Full Cast; Stewart Crank, Jenna Sharpe, Jon Vertullo, Ian Russell, Richard Rohan, Julie-Ann Elliott, Andrew James Spooner, Laura C.

Instead, they find something far worse than death.\nThe colonists aren't dead—they're changed. A new kind of enemy has arrived in Province 921, microscopic invaders that transform humans into perfectly coordinated killing machines. These \"Demon\" parasites don't just control minds; they improve them, creating an army that works with terrifying efficiency.\nAs cities fall and soldiers turn against their own, Centurion James McGill discovers he's mysteriously immune to infection. But immunity comes with a price. To save humanity from becoming pawns of a new Galactic species, McGill must navigate a web of seduction, betrayal, and impossible choices.\nSome invasions come with warships. Others come with a whisper, a touch, and a promise of something better. The question is: what happens when the enemy might be right?\nDemon World is an action-packed entry in B.V. Larson's bestselling Undying Mercenaries series.",

Before the hull breaches. Before the mercenary blockade arrived to claim what she'd found.\nBlack Sky fights dirty. Corridors seal during firefights. Life support fails mid-battle. Ancient weapon systems activate with targeting parameters centuries out of date. Every deck holds new dangers, new systems coming online, new ways to die.\nThe mercenaries keep coming. Boarding pods slam into the hull. Infiltration teams sabotage critical systems. Their leader promises to tear the station apart piece by piece until he gets what he wants.\nSelene's crew fights back with whatever works. Jury-rigged turrets. Reactivated war drones. Corridors flooded with toxins. The station provides weapons, though using them might trigger something worse. Each battle awakens more systems. Each system remembers its purpose.\nThe fights grow deadlier. The station grows hungrier. Something massive stirs in Black Sky's depths, and both sides race to control it.\nWill Selene unlock the ultimate weapon that saves her crew and defeats the invaders? Or will she unleash something that makes the mercenaries look like the lesser evil?",

Three races that humans have clashed with before have allied to halt our expansion into space.

To prevail, the CDF must find out why Boutin did what he did.Jared Dirac is the only human who can provide answers-a superhuman hybrid, created from Boutin+s DNA, whose brain is uniquely able to access Boutin+s electronic memories.

And one way or another—it all ends here.\nFrom the fields of Iowa to deepest space, the final conflict will unfold with only one thing certain: not everyone will survive, but Van will give his last breath to make certain that when future generations speak his name, they will always remember one fact.\nUntil the end, he gave it all for justice, no matter the cost.",

  "bookDescription": "The bestselling adaptation of the iconic video game Halo: Combat Evolved featuring the Master Chief—part of the expanded universe based on the award-winning video game series!2552. Having barely escaped the final battle for Reach against the vast alien alliance known as the Covenant, the crew of the Pillar of Autumn, including Spartan John-117—the Master Chief—and his AI companion Cortana, is forced to make a desperate escape into slipspace. But their destination brings them to an ancient mystery and an even greater struggle. In this far-flung corner of the universe floats a magnificently massive, artificial ringworld. The crew’s only hope of survival is to crash-land on its surface and take the battle opposing the Covenant to the ground. But they soon discover that this enigmatic ringworld is much more than it seems. Built one hundred thousand years ago by a long-lost civilization known as the Forerunners, this “Halo” is worshipped by the Covenant—a sacred artifact they hope will complete their religious quest for supposed transcendence, and they will stop at nothing to control it. Engaging in fierce combat, Master Chief and Cortana will go deep into the Halo construct and uncover its dark secret and true purpose—even as a monstrous and far more vicious enemy than the Covenant emerges to threaten all sentient life on Halo and the galaxy beyond…",

  "bookDescription": "The New York Times bestseller—part of the expanded universe based on the award-winning video game series Halo!The twenty-sixth century. Once considered clandestine, the Spartan-II program has now gone public. Tales of armored super-soldiers fending off thousands of Covenant attacks have become the stuff of legend. While the Master Chief defends a besieged Earth, and the myriad factions of the Covenant continue their crusade to eliminate humanity, an ultra-secret cell of the Office of Naval Intelligence known as “Section Three” devises a plan to buy the UNSC vital time. It will need hundreds of willing soldiers, though—and one more Spartan—to get the job done.  The planet Onyx is virtually abandoned and the perfect place to set this new plan in motion. But when the Master Chief destroys Halo, something is triggered deep within Onyx: Ancient Forerunner technology stirs, and fleets of UNSC and Covenant vessels race to claim it and change the course of the Human-Covenant War. But this reawakened and ancient force may have plans of its own…",

  "bookDescription": "GIVE ME BACK MY LEGIONS!\nIn September of the year 9 A.D. three Roman legions are trapped in the Teutoburg Forest by tens of thousands of rebelling Germanic tribesmen under the Romano-German renegade, Arminius. In an attempt to save what can be saved, an alien starship transports one of those legions, Legio XIIX, to safety. But the aliens are rushed by events and transport the XIIXth not just in space, but through time as well.\nDropped four centuries into their future, under the leadership of their first spear centurion, Marcus Caelius and the young but promising junior tribune, Gaius Pompeius, Legio XIIX must fight to survive almost from the first moments of arrival. Moreover, they must march and fight across a continent to find their way home.\nBecause home, the Roman Empire, needs them—their discipline, their tactics, their indomitable fortitude—more desperately than it has ever needed anything . . . because New Years Eve, 406 A.D. is coming, and with it, a horde of barbarians are going to cross the frozen Rhine and, unless stopped cold, destroy the Empire.\nAt the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).\nPraise for Tom Kratman:“The author’s flair for fight scenes is undeniable.” —Publishers Weekly\n“Tom Kratman's Dirty Water is a time-travel journey to Boston, where a gate that grants wishes brings fresh Christmas angst to the efforts of aliens, witches, a special toy store, and a grandfather's interest in exploring bygone Boston with his granddaughters. Time travel is vividly rendered and immersive in this gritty adventure, which links disparate figures and interests for a delightfully unpredictable romp. Both books are highly recommended for discriminating sci-fi collections.” —Midwest Book Review\nIn 1974, at age seventeen, Tom Kratman became a political refugee and defector from the PRM (People’s Republic of Massachusetts) by virtue of joining the Regular Army. He stayed a Regular Army infantryman most of his adult life, returning to Massachusetts as an unofficial dissident while attending Boston College after his first hitch. Back in the Army, he managed to do just about everything there was to do at one time or another. After the Gulf War, with the bottom dropping completely out of the anti-communist market, Tom decided to become a lawyer. Every now and again, when the frustrations of legal life and having to deal with other lawyers got to be too much, Tom would rejoin the Army (or a somewhat similar group, say) for fun and frolic in other climes. His family, muttering darkly, put up with this for years. He no longer practices law, instead writing full-time for Baen. His novels for Baen include A State of Disobedience, Caliphate, and the series consisting of A Desert Called Peace, Carnifex, The Lotus Eaters, The Amazon Legion, Come and Take Them, The Rods and the Axe, and A Pillar of Fire by Night. With John Ringo, he has written the novels Watch on the Rhine, Yellow Eyes, and The Tuloriad. Also for Baen, he has written the first three volumes of the modern-day military fiction series Countdown. He's recently co-authored the brilliant The Romanov Reign Series with Kacey Ezell and Justin Watson.",

  "bookDescription": "From the New York Times bestselling author of the Expanse comes a spectacular new space opera that sees humanity fighting for its survival in a war as old as the universe itself. ★ “Masterful . . . . This is space opera at its best.” – Publishers Weekly (starred review) \"The start of something truly epic.\" ― Fonda Lee, author of Jade City How humanity came to the planet called Anjiin is lost in the fog of history, but that history is about to end. The Carryx – part empire, part hive – have waged wars of conquest for centuries, destroying or enslaving species across the galaxy. Now, they are facing a great and deathless enemy. The key to their survival may rest with the humans of Anjiin. Caught up in academic intrigue and affairs of the heart, Dafyd Alkhor is pleased just to be an assistant to a brilliant scientist and his celebrated research team. Then the Carryx ships descend, decimating the human population and taking the best and brightest of Anjiin society away to serve on the Carryx homeworld, and Dafyd is swept along with them. They are dropped in the middle of a struggle they barely understand, set in a competition against the other captive species with extinction as the price of failure. Only Dafyd and a handful of his companions see past the Darwinian contest to the deeper game that they must play to survive: learning to understand – and manipulate – the Carryx themselves. With a noble but suicidal human rebellion on one hand and strange and murderous enemies on the other, the team pays a terrible price to become the trusted servants of their new rulers. Dafyd Alkhor is a simple man swept up in events that are beyond his control and more vast than his imagination. He will become the champion of humanity and its betrayer, the most hated man in history and the guardian of his people. This is where his story begins. \"Corey is always one of the most engaging voices in the genre.\" ― Adrian Tchaikovsky, author of Children of Time \"A bang up read. I want more.\" ― Paolo Bacigalupi, author of The Water Knife \"A powerful, provocative masterpiece that I will be thinking about for a very long time.\" ― Ryka Aoki, author of Light from Uncommon Stars",

  "bookDescription": "A retired captain. An experimental starship. A war like no other.\nWhen the research starship Galileo vanishes without a trace, the powers-that-be are quick to bury the incident, eager to prevent escalating tensions that could lead to war. As a former POW, Soren refuses to give the ship up for lost.\nHis daughter is one of the missing.\nTaking matters into his own hands, Soren starts pulling strings and calling in favors, determined to launch a clandestine mission to bring Galileo home. When an old friend offers him a ship for the operation, he expects a rusty relic headed for the scrapyard.\nInstead, he's given the Wraith—an unfinished, experimental starship with plenty of potential and just as many problems. A marvel of engineering…if his crew can keep her running.\nThey’d better.\nBecause Galileo’s disappearance is just the beginning. War is coming to the Federation from the most unlikely of places.\nAnd Soren may be the only one who can stop it.",

The outcome of the war lies on a knife edge. The Warmaster Horus’ bloody seven-year crusade has led to this – the cradle of humanity, where he is to kill his father, the Emperor.\nWith the war at this critical juncture, Sanguinius, primarch of the loyalist Blood Angels, braves the horrors of the Warmaster’s flagship, The Vengeful Spirit, with a single purpose in mind – to slay his brother Horus, decapitate the Heresy once and for all, and stop the forces of Chaos from taking Terra.\nBut at the whim of a Warmaster fallen so far from grace, the Dark Gods will not make Sanguinius’ task easy.

Brought to you in audio by none other than award-winning, chart-topping narrator R.C. Bray.\nHumans are herded like sheep for the slaughter, and their only hope for survival lies with a team who just left the planet.\nFollowing their successful mission to destroy the slaver ring in New York City, Wic and the members of Phantom Team pass through the Antarctic’s origin ring and find themselves deep in the heart of the Androchidan Empire. But as the scope of the alien specie’s operation becomes apparent, Phantom Team realizes they can’t stand by as humanity is culled into submission. Efforts must be made to slow the enemy’s progress, if not stop it altogether.\nUnder Wic’s leadership, the team devises a plan to infiltrate and neutralize part of the Androchidan’s operation. Allies are made, and resources are acquired. But when enemy spies find evidence of collusion, it is only a matter for time before the Phantoms’ hopes of thwarting the enemy are dashed.\nWill Wic and his elite team of warriors succeed in reversing the tide of the Androchidan invasion?

The loyalists are desperate, and the Warmaster’s hordes are certain of their coming victory.\nListen to it because\nThe myriad battles of the Siege of Terra series are pulling into a taut weave of tension, horror, and certain doom. Just when you thought it was bad, it gets worse.\nThe story\nThe walls have fallen. The defenders are broken. The Inner Palace lies in ruins.\nThe Warmaster’s horde advances through the fire and ash of Terra's dying breaths, forcing the loyalists back to the Delphic Battlement—the very walls of the Sanctum Imperialis. Angron, Primarch of the World Eaters and Herald of Horus, has achieved immortality through annihilation—now he leads the armies of the damned in a wrathful tide, destroying all before them as the warp begins its poisonous corruption of Terra's very soil.\nFor the Emperor’s beleaguered forces, the end has come. The Khan lies on the edge of death. Rogal Dorn is encircled, fighting his own war at Bhab Bastion. Guilliman will not reach Terra in time. Without his brothers, Sanguinius—the Angel of the Ninth Legion—waits on the final battlements, hoping to rally a desperate band of defenders and refugees for one last stand.",

Terra now lies within the Warmaster’s sights, the Throneworld and the seat of his father’s rule.

He has become the ascendant vessel of Chaos and amassed a terrible army with which to enact his will and vengeance.\nBut the way to the Throne will be hard as the primarch Rogal Dorn, the Praetorian and protector of Terra, marshals the defences. First and foremost, Horus must challenge the might of the Sol System itself and the many fleets and bulwarks arrayed there.\nTo gain even a foothold on Terran soil, he must first contend the Solar War.

  "bookDescription": "In space, the real adventure starts after the warranty expires.Rix Banner just wants three things out of life: a working coffeemaker, a ship that doesn’t try to kill him, and maybe—just maybe—a full night of sleep without someone pounding on his hatch asking for “one tiny repair.” Naturally, he gets none of them.Between duct-taping patched coolant lines, arguing with an ancient navigation computer, and wrangling Patience Station’s maintenance headaches, Rix can barely keep ahead of the chaos. His shop is overflowing with broken photonic barrier generators, impounded cruisers, and a growing list of “favors” he apparently owes half the station.And that’s before the jobs go sideways.A routine cargo run turns into a mechanical nightmare involving exploding coffee, structural rot, and a ship held together by sheer stubbornness. Amari’s past keeps knocking on the door—sometimes with warrants—and Kel keeps disappearing on risky deliveries that somehow never go to plan. As trouble mounts, Rix finds himself neck-deep in station politics, pirate fallout, suspicious law enforcement, and a whole lot of equipment that definitely did not come with instructions.Fast, funny, and fueled by equal parts chaos and caffeine, Jump Drives and Coffee Stains cranks the wrench harder, flies faster, and doubles down on the blue-collar, grease-stained heroics that made Boltguns and Duct Tape an instant favorite.Strap in for a laugh-out-loud sci-fi ride—get your copy now!",

It's a hedge against interstellar war - and a system of control for the rulers of the empire.\nThe Flow is eternal - but it is not static. Just as a river changes course, The Flow changes as well, cutting off worlds from the rest of humanity. When it's discovered that The Flow is moving, possibly cutting off all human worlds from faster-than-light travel forever, three individuals - a scientist, a starship captain, and the empress of the Interdependency - are in a race against time to discover what, if anything, can be salvaged from an interstellar empire on the brink of collapse.",
