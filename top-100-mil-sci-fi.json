  "bookDescription": "The mission to destroy the enemy Gateway was literally a smashing success.\nExcept the Pirates were too late, and now not one but two of the enemy are loose in the galaxy. And they are equipped with starships more powerful than Valkyrie. A direct fight would be hopeless, so the Pirates must rely on wacky ideas from the mushy brain of a monkey—and some serious sketchiness.\nThe Expeditionary Force saga continues in book 19 from epic sci-fi writer Craig Alanson and narrated by none other than R.C. Bray.",

  "bookDescription": "A Horus Heresy Novel\nHorus has revealed his dark plans, but nobody is prepared for just how far he will go. The force sent to end the Warmaster's rebellion doesn't realise they are heading towards a slaughter unlike anything the galaxy has seen.\nLISTEN TO IT BECAUSE\nIt's the deepest exploration so far of one of the most horrific battles of the Horus Heresy. You may know what happened during the Dropsite Massacre, but you don't know it all. It's far worse than you thought as the treachery is revealed.\nTHE STORY\nHorus has rebelled against the Emperor by purging his and his brother's Legions, but what was supposed to be a secret act of murder has been revealed. In the Emperor's name, Rogal Dorn and Malcador the Sigillite dispatch the largest force of legionaries and primarchs ever assembled to end Horus' rebellion before it can begin.\nBut the loyalists, on their way to enact vengeance, do not know the depth of the betrayal they face. They will not be the perpetrators of a massacre, but its victims. The last hope of returning to the Great Crusade and the unity of the Imperium will die in the dust of Isstvan V, and those who survive will live in a new age of darkness.\nWritten by John French. Narrated by Jonathan Keeble. Runtime 11 hours and 27 minutes approx.",

  "bookDescription": "From New York Times bestselling author Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game―adapted to film starring Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford―is the classic Hugo and Nebula award-winning science fiction novel of a young boy's recruitment into the midst of an interstellar war.In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut―young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.THE ENDER UNIVERSEEnder seriesEnder’s Game / Ender in Exile / Speaker for the Dead / Xenocide / Children of the MindEnder’s Shadow seriesEnder’s Shadow / Shadow of the Hegemon / Shadow Puppets / Shadow of the Giant / Shadows in FlightChildren of the FleetThe First Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)Earth Unaware / Earth Afire / Earth AwakensThe Second Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)The Swarm /The HiveEnder novellasA War of Gifts /First Meetings",

Calamity is loose, and it's been busy learning—from its time with Netty to running wild among the stars, the ultimate evil seeks nothing less than complete dominion over all space and time.\nAnd for Calamity, life is in the way.\nVan and his crew will enlist old friends, new friends, and the very beings he sought to protect from his first days as a rookie Peacemaker, fighting for the dignity of those who had no voices during the dark years of a corrupt guild.\nIt all comes down to this. And one way or another—it all ends here.\nFrom the fields of Iowa to deepest space, the final conflict will unfold with only one thing certain: not everyone will survive, but Van will give his last breath to make certain that when future generations speak his name, they will always remember one fact.\nUntil the end, he gave it all for justice, no matter the cost.",

Humanity has expanded beyond Earth’s system to hundreds of planets that colonists now call home. But the United Earth Government and the United Nations Space Command is struggling to control this vast empire. After exhausting all strategies to keep seething colonial insurrections from exploding into a full-blown interplanetary civil war, the UNSC has one last hope. At the Office of Naval Intelligence, Dr. Catherine Halsey has been hard at work on a top-secret program that could bring an end to the conflict…and it starts with seventy-five children, among them a six-year-old boy named John. And Halsey could never guess that this child will eventually become the final hope against an even greater peril engulfing the galaxy—the inexorable confrontation with a theocratic military alliance of alien races known as the Covenant. This is the electrifying origin story of Spartan John-117—the Master Chief—and of his legendary, unstoppable heroism in leading the resistance against humanity’s possible extinction.",

Golden Son continues the stunning saga of Darrow, a rebel forged by tragedy, battling to lead his oppressed people to freedom.\nAdapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music!\nAs a Red, Darrow grew up working the mines deep beneath the surface of Mars, enduring backbreaking labor while dreaming of the better future he was building for his descendants. But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow’s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds—and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within.\nA lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love—but also the wrath of powerful rivals. To wage and win the war that will change humankind’s destiny, Darrow must confront the treachery arrayed against him, overcome his all-too-human desire for retribution—and strive not for violent revolt but a hopeful rebirth. Though the road ahead is fraught with danger and deceit, Darrow must choose to follow Eo’s principles of love and justice to free his people.\nHe must live for more.\nPerformed by Full Cast; Stewart Crank, Jenna Sharpe, Jon Vertullo, Ian Russell, Richard Rohan, Julie-Ann Elliott, Andrew James Spooner, Laura C.

Even more puzzling, the ship is of human construction. As the ship regains functionality, traps left by mutineers threaten the lives of Archer and the tiny crew aboard the derelict.When he succeeds in bringing Defender back to Alliance space, an idealistic scientist posts critical information regarding Defender’s advanced technology. The Nemeans and Scyllans press for peace talks—a delaying tactic while they evaluate the information dump. When they learn that implementation is at least a year away, they break the truce violently, attempting to capture the Alliance and EU delegates during peace talks on Earth.Archer suffers devastating losses in the attack, which he has difficulty processing emotionally. Bette has her own issues of this type, and the two part on uncertain terms. She then disappears, leaving a cryptic note.Defender’s Awakening is a pulse-pounding space opera of interstellar intrigue, moral dilemmas, and fragile emotional bonds. It’s perfect for fans of epic sci-fi adventures, where heroes must not only battle their foes but also control their hearts.Book 4 of a new military science fiction series from award-winning author John J.

Instead, they find something far worse than death.\nThe colonists aren't dead—they're changed. A new kind of enemy has arrived in Province 921, microscopic invaders that transform humans into perfectly coordinated killing machines. These \"Demon\" parasites don't just control minds; they improve them, creating an army that works with terrifying efficiency.\nAs cities fall and soldiers turn against their own, Centurion James McGill discovers he's mysteriously immune to infection. But immunity comes with a price. To save humanity from becoming pawns of a new Galactic species, McGill must navigate a web of seduction, betrayal, and impossible choices.\nSome invasions come with warships. Others come with a whisper, a touch, and a promise of something better. The question is: what happens when the enemy might be right?\nDemon World is an action-packed entry in B.V.

Those who hold on to power must decide how to wield it, and a new structure must be put in place, all while desires to exact vengeance run high.READ IT BECAUSEIt's the beginning of an epic series. Find out what happens after the cataclysmic events of the Horus Heresy, as an unsteady Imperium must find its footing and learn how to exist without the guidance of the Emperor.THE STORYHorus is dead. Terra lies in ruins. The Emperor is silent. Amid the rubble of the Palace, shell-shocked survivors emerge into the light of an uncertain dawn. New powers are present now, ones that have travelled the length of the galaxy to bring salvation to the Imperium, though they are as readily cast as usurpers as redeemers. The survivors of the Traitors’ Grand Armada, now scattered and desperate to escape vengeance, are riven with doubt and dissension, and their gods too are silent. Amid all the grief and confusion, some hopeful souls believe the war to be over and an era of renewal just ahead. But wiser heads know that this war can never end, and that the only question remaining is who shall rise to power within the perilous new age, and who shall fall.Written by Chris Wraight.",

A tripartite agreement between the Colonial Union, the Earth, and the alien Conclave has kept the forces of war at bay, even when some would have preferred to return to the fighting and struggle of former times. For now, more sensible heads have prevailed – and have even championed unity.  But now, there is a new force that threatens the hard-maintained peace: The Consu, the most advanced intelligent species humans have ever met, are on the cusp of a species-defining civil war. This war is between Consu factions... but nothing the Consu ever do is just about them. The Colonial Union, the Earth and the Conclave have been unwillingly dragged into the conflict, in the most surprising of ways.  Gretchen Trujillo is a mid-level diplomat, working in an unimportant part of the Colonial Union bureaucracy. But when she is called to take part in a secret mission involving representatives from every powerful faction in space, what she finds there has the chance to redefine the destinies of humans and aliens alike... or destroy them forever.",

  "bookDescription": "The final enemy has been revealed, and it's more insidious than Van could ever imagine, spanning space and time with the patience of immortality—and an utter disregard for all forms of life.\nOn the run and broken, the Equal Grasp faces elimination on earth and everywhere else, their leader gone, their mission a shambles, and with new agents of justice hard on their heels.\nBut the fight isn't over. In fact, it's just begun, and Van knows that every decision he's made for the past decade will come to bear on who lives, and who dies—and who is meant to rule over a universe where freedom and justice are the ultimate pursuit.\nAt any cost, Van and his crew will finish the job, but they're going to need a lot of help from people and beings who have been observers.\nUntil now.\nThe time for watching is over. The time for victory is now. But the cost might be more than anyone can pay, and Van is no longer merely an agent of justice. He's a father, a husband, and a friend—and he's going to need every connection in the stars to defeat the ultimate enemy and save his people.",

  "bookDescription": "Perfect for an entry-level sci-fi listener and the ideal addition to a veteran fan’s collection, John Scalzi's Old Man’s War will take audiences on a heart-stopping adventure into the far corners of the universe.  John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army.  The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce—and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.  Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.  John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine—and what he will become is far stranger.   John Scalzi's Old Man's War is a stunning novel of the long war for human survival—in a universe replete with hostility",

For hundreds of years, the fighters of the Kusanagi Peninsula have held the Empire's enemies at bay, earning their frozen spit of land the name \"The Sword of Kaigen\".\nBorn into Kusanagi's legendary Matsuda family, f14-year-old Mamoru has always known his purpose: To master his family's fighting techniques and defend his homeland. But when an outsider arrives and pulls back the curtain on Kaigen's alleged age of peace, Mamoru realizes that he might not have much time to become the fighter he was bred to be. Worse, the empire he was bred to defend may stand on a foundation of lies.\nMisaki told herself that she left the passions of her youth behind when she married into the Matsuda house. Determined to be a good housewife and mother, she hid away her sword, along with everything from her days as a fighter in a faraway country. But with her growing son asking questions about the outside world, the threat of an impending invasion looming across the sea, and her frigid husband grating on her nerves, Misaki finds the fighter in her clawing its way back to the surface.\nWhen the winds of war reach their peninsula, will the Matsuda family have the strength to defend their empire? Or will they tear each other apart before the true enemies even reach their shores?",

Chaney return with Gods and Men, book two of the Ruins of the Earth series, what fans call “the best military sci-fi of the year”, and “Galaxy’s Edge meets Expeditionary Force”. Brought to you in audio by none other than award-winning, chart-topping narrator R.C. Bray.\nHumans are herded like sheep for the slaughter, and their only hope for survival lies with a team who just left the planet.\nFollowing their successful mission to destroy the slaver ring in New York City, Wic and the members of Phantom Team pass through the Antarctic’s origin ring and find themselves deep in the heart of the Androchidan Empire. But as the scope of the alien specie’s operation becomes apparent, Phantom Team realizes they can’t stand by as humanity is culled into submission. Efforts must be made to slow the enemy’s progress, if not stop it altogether.\nUnder Wic’s leadership, the team devises a plan to infiltrate and neutralize part of the Androchidan’s operation. Allies are made, and resources are acquired. But when enemy spies find evidence of collusion, it is only a matter for time before the Phantoms’ hopes of thwarting the enemy are dashed.\nWill Wic and his elite team of warriors succeed in reversing the tide of the Androchidan invasion? Or will they succumb to the unrelenting power of the most notorious slaver operation in the galaxy?",

It's a hedge against interstellar war - and a system of control for the rulers of the empire.\nThe Flow is eternal - but it is not static. Just as a river changes course, The Flow changes as well, cutting off worlds from the rest of humanity. When it's discovered that The Flow is moving, possibly cutting off all human worlds from faster-than-light travel forever, three individuals - a scientist, a starship captain, and the empress of the Interdependency - are in a race against time to discover what, if anything, can be salvaged from an interstellar empire on the brink of collapse.",

Though it comes at a great cost. For each time she is slain, Saint Celestine finds herself trapped in a terrible realm of suffering and torment. There her faith in the God-Emperor will be put to the test so she may prove herself worthy of life once more.",

  "bookDescription": "A retired captain. An experimental starship. A war like no other.\nWhen the research starship Galileo vanishes without a trace, the powers-that-be are quick to bury the incident, eager to prevent escalating tensions that could lead to war. As a former POW, Soren refuses to give the ship up for lost.\nHis daughter is one of the missing.\nTaking matters into his own hands, Soren starts pulling strings and calling in favors, determined to launch a clandestine mission to bring Galileo home. When an old friend offers him a ship for the operation, he expects a rusty relic headed for the scrapyard.\nInstead, he's given the Wraith—an unfinished, experimental starship with plenty of potential and just as many problems. A marvel of engineering…if his crew can keep her running.\nThey’d better.\nBecause Galileo’s disappearance is just the beginning. War is coming to the Federation from the most unlikely of places.\nAnd Soren may be the only one who can stop it.",

Having barely escaped the final battle for Reach against the vast alien alliance known as the Covenant, the crew of the Pillar of Autumn, including Spartan John-117—the Master Chief—and his AI companion Cortana, is forced to make a desperate escape into slipspace. But their destination brings them to an ancient mystery and an even greater struggle. In this far-flung corner of the universe floats a magnificently massive, artificial ringworld. The crew’s only hope of survival is to crash-land on its surface and take the battle opposing the Covenant to the ground. But they soon discover that this enigmatic ringworld is much more than it seems. Built one hundred thousand years ago by a long-lost civilization known as the Forerunners, this “Halo” is worshipped by the Covenant—a sacred artifact they hope will complete their religious quest for supposed transcendence, and they will stop at nothing to control it. Engaging in fierce combat, Master Chief and Cortana will go deep into the Halo construct and uncover its dark secret and true purpose—even as a monstrous and far more vicious enemy than the Covenant emerges to threaten all sentient life on Halo and the galaxy beyond…",

As conquerors, they have no demands, no explanations, simply harsh consequences should they be challenged. Releasing a plague and plunging the world into a new Dark Age, the Entities seem unbeatable.

They are raiding for supplies, or receiving them from sympathizers as they cut a path across the Empire encouraging all who will listen to rise up and overthrow their father. Whether they be allies, enemies, or something else is unclear, but the Emperor has loaned a large Mainline Fleet to Aatroxiss for him to use to stop them if the Imperial Fleet cannot, and with so many traitors in their midst, it looks like Visha and Victa will make it to the distant Frontier within approximately two years of their public rebellion. Grand Admiral Aatroxiss knows better than to let them get into the Frontier, so he waits for them to get close to the border then takes High Admiral Greganin's fleet out to confront them. No matter how this goes down, it will reshape the political landscape within the Empire permanently, and with rising tensions amongst the lesser Dynasties, the word being floated in the public discourse more and more is one no one wants to hear.

  "bookDescription": "The Siege of Terra Book 1\nAfter years of devastating war, Horus and his forces have arrived at Terra. But before they can set foot on the Throneworld, they must first break the defences of the Sol System.\nPowerful fleets and cunning defences bar their path - but can anything hope to halt the advance of the Traitor armada?\nListen to it because:\nThe final act of the long-running, best-selling series starts here, with a brutal and uncompromising look at the first stage of the Siege of Terra, the war to conquer the solar system. Armies will fall, heroes will rise and legends will be written....\nThe Story\nAfter seven years of bitter war, the end has come at last for the conflict known infamously as the Horus Heresy. Terra now lies within the Warmaster’s sights, the Throneworld and the seat of his father’s rule. Horus’ desire is nothing less than the death of the Emperor of Mankind and the utter subjugation of the Imperium. He has become the ascendant vessel of Chaos and amassed a terrible army with which to enact his will and vengeance.\nBut the way to the Throne will be hard as the primarch Rogal Dorn, the Praetorian and protector of Terra, marshals the defences. First and foremost, Horus must challenge the might of the Sol System itself and the many fleets and bulwarks arrayed there.\nTo gain even a foothold on Terran soil, he must first contend the Solar War. Thus the first stage of the greatest conflict in the history of all mankind begins.",

Sensing massive profits, the scramble to exploit humanity pits Van against his own people—and Yotov, whose plans have finally come to fruition.\nWith political warfare, the Equal Grasp seeks to do what missiles cannot—remove Van from the picture. But he's a lot tougher than that. Icky's hammer is swinging freely, and the crew are international stars, portrayed as the heroes of a world that reaches beyond the sky, into deepest space and beyond.\nWith one last throw of the dice, Yotov will unleash the hidden reserve of power she's been hiding. If it works, Van will be dead. Or worse.\nBecause Yotov and the Equal Grasp don't just want power; they want control of life itself, and they'll stop at nothing to get it.",

  "bookDescription": "From the New York Times bestselling author of the Expanse comes a spectacular new space opera that sees humanity fighting for its survival in a war as old as the universe itself. ★ “Masterful . . . . This is space opera at its best.” – Publishers Weekly (starred review) \"The start of something truly epic.\" ― Fonda Lee, author of Jade City How humanity came to the planet called Anjiin is lost in the fog of history, but that history is about to end. The Carryx – part empire, part hive – have waged wars of conquest for centuries, destroying or enslaving species across the galaxy. Now, they are facing a great and deathless enemy. The key to their survival may rest with the humans of Anjiin. Caught up in academic intrigue and affairs of the heart, Dafyd Alkhor is pleased just to be an assistant to a brilliant scientist and his celebrated research team. Then the Carryx ships descend, decimating the human population and taking the best and brightest of Anjiin society away to serve on the Carryx homeworld, and Dafyd is swept along with them. They are dropped in the middle of a struggle they barely understand, set in a competition against the other captive species with extinction as the price of failure. Only Dafyd and a handful of his companions see past the Darwinian contest to the deeper game that they must play to survive: learning to understand – and manipulate – the Carryx themselves. With a noble but suicidal human rebellion on one hand and strange and murderous enemies on the other, the team pays a terrible price to become the trusted servants of their new rulers. Dafyd Alkhor is a simple man swept up in events that are beyond his control and more vast than his imagination. He will become the champion of humanity and its betrayer, the most hated man in history and the guardian of his people. This is where his story begins. \"Corey is always one of the most engaging voices in the genre.\" ― Adrian Tchaikovsky, author of Children of Time \"A bang up read. I want more.\" ― Paolo Bacigalupi, author of The Water Knife \"A powerful, provocative masterpiece that I will be thinking about for a very long time.\" ― Ryka Aoki, author of Light from Uncommon Stars",
