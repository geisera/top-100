Humanity's future hangs in the balance… and its best hope may be a reluctant pilot who wasn't supposed to be here at all.Accidental Astronaut is a gripping, fast-paced blend of survival thriller and epic science fiction—perfect for fans of Andy Weir, Michael Crichton, and James Rollins.",

        "reviewDescription": "Defender picks up one of the dangling threads from the previous novel in the series Enthraller – what happened to Special Forces Captain Ethan and Head of Planetary Defence Velda – and runs with it.We have some early overlap in the time-line with Enthraller but see a different set of events from a new perspective as we are taken on a wild ride with Ethan & Velda as they are attacked, evade the enemy and are captured by turn.Defender includes all the elements I have come to expect from Michelle Diener’s work, action, adventure, romance and great characters.In Defender we also get to find out a bit more about our villains which was fascinating as is leading to what promises to be a very exciting final book.It does have a minor issue that kept it from being a five star for me tho – that was the ending felt incomplete. It was clearly setting things up to bring together elements from previous books in the final book and while not a total cliffhanger, it did feel to me like it left Ethan & Velda’s story not entirely resolved.I am both excited and sad for the next book as it will be great to read the conclusion but I also don’t want this series to end.I received and ARC from the author but all view expressed are my own",

        "reviewDescription": "Defender ties a lot of strings together from the other Verdant Strings series. It helps to have read the other books, for context, but is a complete novel that can be enjoyed alone, too. It doesn’t have a cliffhanger, but does make it clear there will be another book to continue the story of the 2 main characters. Ethan and Velda are mentioned in a previous book, and get their own story here. Boy, those two have some of the worst, and best, luck of all of the stories. They get pulled this way and that, but always come through in the end. We also get a clearer view about Linao and the Cores and their relationship with the Caruso aliens. I thoroughly enjoyed this story and highly recommend!",

        "reviewDescription": "This is book 8 in the Verdant String series and is the penultimate book to this series. This book makes more sense if you have read the previous book Enthraller as some action is concurrent in the two books. This book connects many characters  and plot lines from the whole series but does end in a cliffhanger to be resolved in the next and final book in the series which also takes us back to the world of Book 7 Peace Maker.  I truly enjoy Michelle Diener's writing and world building and eagerly await her next book. I received an ARC of this book.",

The back story is a continuation of Enthraller but only as much as it is about a different couple. This story is filled with captures and escapes and the awakening interest between our H/h. What I like best about Michelle Diener’s books is that there is a decided balance between story and romance. Would make a great tv series. Would I recommend this book? Yes with the caveat that they read the series first and if not at least Enthraller.",

It can be read as a stand-alone but would be better appreciated by reading the previous novels in the series first.Defender continues the rediscovery of knowledge about the ancestors of the Verdant String settlers and their technological developments. It reintroduces the Cores and the Caruso as the antagonists of the Verdant String society.It is also develops the romance between the two main characters who were introduced in ‘Enthraller’, Ethan Hyt and Velda Shanïha.As a fan of the entire Verdant String series I found that this novel didn’t disappoint. I’m feeling ambivalent that the series will end with the subsequent novel but excited to see all the threads coming together.",

After decades of model-trained AIs wreaking havoc across the globe, humanity is ready to try something a little more…human.Henry is perfect. For one thing, as a reconstituted intelligence, he has no rights and can be forced to do the bidding of the powers that be. For another, he’s the only Heritage Mind™ with any military experience that survived the Great Power Surge of 2072.So, Henry’s it.Blastoff, good Henry! Our hopes and dreams go with you. Oh, and while you’re at it, could you take a look at the aliens setting up shop in our asteroid belt? They seem to be…multiplying.Download I, Starship now and grab the edge of your seat for this bold new space opera.",

Now imagine that your consciousness controls your new body - a state-of-the-art starship - what would you do now? What a great premise for a story. \"I, Starship\" is a story of just such a transfer of consciousness. Now image that your normal bodily functions like breathing, seeing, hearing, etc. are functions of the ship - air circulation systems, cameras throughout the ship (internal and external) that give you sight, microphones to allow you to hear everything that goes on in the ship, etc.  In addition, you control ship movement, both direction and speed. Oh, and not to forget the ships armament for protection from anything else you run into. What a super concept. Great story, great characters, and very interesting situations out in deep space. This is a wonderful read - go get this book.",

        "reviewDescription": "Henry is a human who gets taken out by a flying lawnmower. He wakes up about 100 years in the future not knowing where he is or what has happened to him. It turns out that scientists uploaded Henry's mind to a computer file—including all his emotions and memories. So when Henry is awakened, he is shocked to find out he is essentially an AI overseeing operations on a Military ship in route to our nearest neighboring star. Not everyone understands Henry. The captain thinks he is nothing more than software to be used when needed—and he rarely sees the need for Henry. After a rocky start, Henry finds himself with many of his permissions on board ship denied and basically allowed only to monitor the outside sensors. On top of all this, Henry has his own guardian AI. This program, called GARY for short, has a very narrow view of what Henry is allowed to do during the long years the crew is asleep. If Henry asks the wrong question, it can cause Gary to start a routine to wake up the captain which is the last thing Henry wants.This book is a hoot to read. Henry gets into all sorts of trouble as he tries his best to keep the crew safe and see that their ship gets to its destination without incident. There is a serious side to the story too. Aliens have taken up residence in the Kuiper belt and are building some kind of structure for want of a better term. The crew must investigate this site before they can head for the stars. As the crew heads for the Kuiper belt things do not go as planned. If memory serves, this is when Henry tries to offer unsolicited advice and is sanctioned by the captain—permissions begin to be taken away. Henry is shocked by the captain's attitude toward him but can do nothing about it but live within the guidelines the captain sets.I thoroughly enjoyed this story and am looking forward to book 2. I was surprised when Scott came out with this story as I know he has a couple of others in the works. He's really working hard to give us fans excellent SciFi to read. Thanks Scott!!!",

        "reviewDescription": "Although one can't say it's unique, I've rarely seen a story that considers using a reconstituted human that was originally alive. Although the concept is refreshing, a think the delivery is stereo typical.  The captain is unreasonable in his criticism, and is reluctant to learn from his errors. I would expect a sterling crew such as makes up the interchange to be more polished in their conduct.  It isn't their banter, as its the lack of any cohesion when performing their tactics such as breaking and running rather than a coordinated withdrawal.  Even the idea of a battle tested marine sergeant being such a milktoast doesn't fly very well. I also consider it poor tactics to have acquired such treasures as the codex, the drones, and the information provided by the friendlies, and risk their loss by proceeding forward into another unknown hot zone.  In the end, I don't think highly of the character development or decisions made, but I find the basic premise interesting enough that I will try to read the sequel.",

Probably a residual of my childhood growing up watching Star Trek on television.When I first saw this book, I thought that the idea had been done before in the \"Bobiverse\" books, where human personalities become flight computers, essentially.  I thought I'd be able to digest this book easily enough after that series.  Maybe I was wrong, as I read most of this \"I Robot\" series.  The similarities ended at the plot device and the personalities made this it's own story.Recommended reading.",

Throw in an AI which is stupid but has the task over overseeing Henry, it all becomes a bit of a page-filling exercise. Had trouble finishing the book and already bought part 2 as well.

        "reviewDescription": "This is book 1 in a new series by Scott Bartlett. The first thing that came to mind after reading it was wow, this is how to begin a series.The author got me right at the start of the book when he ‘killed’ off the main character with a flying lawnmower and made him into a sentient AI. One of the main threads running through the book is how the various characters interact and treat the sentient AI that used to be alive.The story takes us on a journey through near and far space in order to evaluate and deal with a possible/probable threat to Earth. The story was fun, interesting and moved at a good pace. It takes place over 80 years (the travel time to the far space location). The author continued to build on the plot and the characters as the book went along. There are incidents that occur during the 80 years that affect both the ship and crew. The ending of this book leads into the next, which the author is in the process of researching and developing.I found the main characters to be well written and relatable. They were interesting and their actions were usually, based on their personality, what you would expect. There were characters that I liked and some I didn’t (again, based on their personality or actions).I thought the tech the author created was good and reasonable based on what could be available in the near future.I thoroughly enjoyed the book, gave it 5 stars and I recommend it based on the above.",

        "reviewDescription": "This book was wonderful.Some people think this series is getting stale, and that there's always some crazy event to react to. This book ups the stakes. There's a reason why this book is called \"Armageddon\". There are some revelations, and ideas I haven't heard of in other science fiction series.Craig Alanson really portrayed the rivalries between different countries in his series quite well. This series has really good representation and diversity, and alien species feel very unique.This series also has some good character development. Joe Bishop often questions himself and has many doubts, and it makes him human.There have been so many events that the Expeditionary Force had to deal with, that every time the author references them, I start getting them mixed up. It would be nice if there was a list of events that have happened so far. A timeline would be nice. Maybe a map of the galaxy would also help us imagine different locations in space. Overall, there were some moments that were confusing, such as why the main characters had to cancel a cover story.However, there is an event mentioned in this book that is quite confusing. There is mention of a Kristang attack on Wright-Patterson Air Force base, but I don't recall any such attack happening at the end of Book 7. If Craig Alanson meant for this to be backstory of what happened between books 7 and 8, he could have explained it in a clearer manner.There are also many typos in this book. I feel like the quality of the editing dropped a little from the previous books in the series. There were probably about 20-40 typos in the book, and while it didn't take me out of the story, it was a small hindrance. The beginning of the book was also a little slow, and lacked action.There was also one frustrating moment, which is a series of frustrating moments in this series. The main character, Joe, had the chance to pick up some advanced alien technology, yet didn't. I'd like to see a progression of technology, for characters and humanity to grow, to better be able to handle the alien threats out there. It keeps the story interesting and the plot moving. I felt like this was just an excuse to not write some more imaginative alien technology. However, there are advances in the technology in other ways, so that's nice.The author also had the main character say \"I avoided using the temporary name 'Avalon' because part of the team resented that Eurocentric Anglo-Saxon name, or some politically correct ... I didn't care about (location 2769). While Craig Alanson has done a great job including diversity and country rivalries in his series, this comment was a little off the mark. He could have shown different countries having different opinions about what to name Avalon (I won't say what it is because I don't want to spoil it for you), but Joe's thought, above, just didn't make sense.Finally, Craig Alanson does a great job bringing his world to life. Even inanimate objects are brought to life, such as in the case of missiles that \"talk\" to each other.Can't wait for the next book in the series. I'm currently trying to read the Mavericks book, which is supposed to be read before this book. But that book is hard to get through because it has way too many typos and is pretty boring to read compared to book 3.5 in this series about the ExForce team stuck on Paradise.",

The only time it seems like Joe and skippy or any character development at all is when they get the flower, and when they get the valkyrie.Humor is a 9/10 in this series for meCharacter development is a 1/10Cool factor 8/10Flow of story 8.5/10Danger factor 5/10The pirates may mainly be military, but it's like most of the time they seem to be acting almost exactly the same as the beginning of the series. It's been YEARS in this story easily six years easily, and huge events keep happening yet, the main characters have very minor changes.Not only that, but while there are breaking moments it's in a way that's only semi realistic to me I suppose, or when characters I kinda know die, and a buncha randoms it's like \"eh whatever.*. I want to be able to say these main characters mean alot to me but I would of needed more heartfelt moments etc.Because I want a character to get me emotional when they die because it's like i KNOW them.Overall very good book, good or decent in some ways, disappointing in others. But overall I think that the ups of this series makes it worth atleast considering a buy. That's why I'm giving it a 4 out of 5. If I thought it would be a absolutely fantastic purchase I would 5/5 it... Also if you have a kindle unlimited subscription just use that to read it, and decide for yourself if you want to support Craig.",

        "reviewTitle": "Craig FTW, AGAIN!",
        "reviewDescription": "One of my favorite things about Expeditionary Force is Craig's ability to mix seat-of-the-pants nervous excitement about nearly continuous cliffhangers sprinkled throughout his books, with humor, a hint of legitimate science, and a great military Sci-fi story containing plenty of nerdy easter egg references to other famous sci-fi works. This book was my favorite of the series. I particularly loved how he defeated his own record of setting up each subsequent book with a bigger and jucier cliffhanger than the previous book in the series - Armageddon takes the cake. If he supersedes the cliffhanger in this book with one, much less each of the multiple stories left in this series, I'm not sure my emotions will be able to handle the intensity.The ending of this book foreshadowed potential short term problems at earth from a third tier species, acknowledged pending Armageddon for the humans at the hands of one or both apex species, left us wondering what scared the most powerful species in the history of the galaxy enough to run them off to a non-corporial existence (while insinuating Skippy and the humans could do something about a threat even the Elders fled from), and mentioned the need of the MBoP to do address both senior species possessing their own Elder AIs.The ending setup half a dozen more books with these unanswered questions.Craig, if you read this review. I HAAAAAATE you, you stupid monkey!!! I hope the universe comes back to kick you in the a$$ for what you do to us, the fans of your books. My heart can't take much more of this.",

        "reviewTitle": "Best in the Series",
        "reviewDescription": "The eighth novel in the Expeditionary Force series exceeded my expectations to a level then even Skippy would have trouble calculating. Any long running series has to deal with the need to keep things interesting without falling foul of repeating plot points or making things too stupid to retain the narrative which captured the reader in the first place, Armageddon achieved this.I will admit I was a little lost with all the talk about their previous mission (convinced myself I had skipped a novel) but once I had that figured out I fell right back into the swing of things with the merry band of pirates. I am not going to go into any plot points because well nothing I can say would be a surprise to a regular reader and if you are not yet been lured into the adventures of Joe and Skippy then by all means grab a copy of Columbus Day and welcome to the family.So my review, this novel was exceptional in that it delivered everything you would want from this series but presented it with icing and a bow, maybe even balloons. That said the knife got twisted good a proper but again you can't realistically have this sort of long running tale without the fact that there are consequences to actions and even inactions.  There are not many novels that really make me want to keep reading be it late a night or during a break at work but every time I put the kindle down I was desperate to delve right back into the story. I'm not sure how the consequences of the events in this novel will pan out, maybe in a manner which reflects the changing status of the galaxy but I know I am going to enjoy it.My hat is tipped to Craig for this well written and immensely enjoyable novel.",

Voor mij is het sterke uit deze reeks vooral de interactie tussen Skippy en Joe maar zeker ook de vragen waar Skippy vandaan komt en wat de Elders nu precies waren en waar zij zijn. Op die vragen wordt in dit boek iets meer verteld (en je ziet daar alweer een  volgende deel in). In dit boek komen gelukkig niet veel ellenlange beschrijvingen van ruimtegevechten (ik blader daar snel doorheen om te zien hoe het afgelopen is (tip: eigenlijk altijd goed)) en iets meer \"science\". Ik hoop dat de schrijver in het volgende boek tot een mooie afronding komt rond Skippy, de Elders en de dreiging van buiten. Het heeft lang genoeg geduurd.",

    "bookDescription": "From New York Times bestselling author Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game―adapted to film starring Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford―is the classic Hugo and Nebula award-winning science fiction novel of a young boy's recruitment into the midst of an interstellar war.In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut―young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.THE ENDER UNIVERSEEnder seriesEnder’s Game / Ender in Exile / Speaker for the Dead / Xenocide / Children of the MindEnder’s Shadow seriesEnder’s Shadow / Shadow of the Hegemon / Shadow Puppets / Shadow of the Giant / Shadows in FlightChildren of the FleetThe First Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)Earth Unaware / Earth Afire / Earth AwakensThe Second Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)The Swarm /The HiveEnder novellasA War of Gifts /First Meetings",

        "reviewTitle": "Amazing, thought-provoking. About kids, but not FOR kids.",
        "reviewDescription": "Plot:It is the future. Earth has survived an attack from an insectile alien race - barely. Population control laws are in effect. Families are limited to 2 children. Young children are monitored to see if they have military potential, and those that show promise at an early age are whisked away to train in the military's Battle School, in the hopes that by the time they reach adulthood, they will possess the necessary skills to defend the Earth, if the aliens - \"buggers\" - ever return.Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin is a rare third child in his family. His older brother and sister showed intellectual promise, but his brother was too ruthless and his sister too compassionate to qualify for Battle School. So the Wiggin parents were permitted a third chance to produce a military prodigy. And they succeeded.Ender is whisked away to Battle School at the ripe old age of 6. The School, located on a space station orbiting the Earth, is populated by military officers and child prodigies. Ender is one of the youngest.And these are not your average children.They train daily in space military tactics, weaponry, and combat. Although they are all at an age that we associate with Dora, Spongebob, and Hannah Montana, these kids are nothing like the children currently roaming your local elementary school hallway. They are calculating, intuitive, sometimes ruthless, always dangerous.One of the main focuses of the School is the battleroom, where the children are equipped with special suits and laser guns that allow them to fight each other in zero-gravity. On Ender's first trip to the battleroom, it becomes quickly apparent that he is a cut above the other students. Some of his peers respect this. Some are threatened by it.And as Ender works his way up through the ranks of Battle School, his teachers take notice, and wonder if perhaps Ender is the child they've been waiting for. The child who can change everything. The child who can save Earth.Why I Love It:Don't let the summary throw you off. Ender's Game may be a book about children, but it is by no means a book for children. The children in this book are nothing like how we picture children (as the mother of an almost-6-year-old, I can say this pretty definitively). Everything about this book is aimed at an adult audience.Ender's Game is not a thriller or adventure story, although some of the battleroom scenes are exciting. More than anything, it's an examination of the mind of Ender Wiggin, the culture he lives in, and a world under military rule. And it's all fascinating.Mr. Card writes Ender in a way that while you understand he is just a child, you can still be awed, chilled, and amazed at his thoughts and actions. As a matter of fact, all of the characters are interesting and intriguing, from his friends at the Battle School, to his sociopath brother Peter, to the Commander of the Battle School, Colonel Graff.There is a twist at the end of Ender's Game. You may see it coming; you may not. I did, but it didn't lessen my enjoyment of the book one bit. The fact that I have read this book over and over again, in spite of knowing the twist ending, speaks to the strong writing of the rest of the book. The book doesn't exist just to throw you off at the end. The book exists to make you think, to draw you completely into the character of Ender, and to absorb you in the science-fiction world he lives in.",

        "reviewDescription": "Being a first-time reader of Ender's Game at the age of 26 (perhaps late to the party), I soon came to find that this book is not by any means easy to put down. In fact, I read most of it between customers at work on my iPhone. I recall reading sci-fi quite a bit when I was in junior high and high school, but most of the novels I read were just expansions on already popular film works such as Star Trek, Star Wars, Aliens, etc. None of those were particularly memorable in having a great degree of depth, but the stories were still enjoyable. That being said however, Ender's Game is far more than just a science fiction novel. Unlike other books in the sci-fi genre, I felt compelled to pay close attention to every detail. I'm actually glad I picked it up now that I'm older and able to comprehend the complexity of emotion and ideas present in such a book--a feat which I'm sure would come at a much younger age for Ender himself.From the very first page, it's obvious that Colonel Graff is the \"bad guy\", until you later come to realize that in this book, such terms make about as much sense as floating in nullo gravity. In fact, Card's entire description of the like combined with his emphasis on the reorientation and breaking down of a young, impressionable mind through such tactics as surrounding Ender with enemies, constantly moving and pushing him, forcing him into positions that demand the most of abilities he is still too naive to realize are within him--much as he may deny them--all of it creates a constant tension. What you eventually discover about the story itself is that this tension provides just enough gravity by which to anchor the reader down before hurling you into the Battle Room, where you must then abolish your preconceived notions of what it means to be good or evil and right or wrong. In Ender's Game, these ideas are frequently challenged, frequently protested, but always justified.Everything depends on Ender's abilities as much as his willingness to continue. Whether the imminent destruction of Earth will occur or not is irrelevant to him. What matters most is his personal desire for love, happiness, and comfort, yet even these are often stripped away as inconsequential--be they from higher authority or at rare points, even by Ender himself--when it comes to his deep underlying NEED, above all, to UNDERSTAND--and therefore LOVE, in its highest form--that which he hates most. Sometimes, it is himself he hates the most. Sometimes it is Graff, other times it's the enemy of the chapter or scene. Stilson, Bonzo, Rose the Nose, etc. From any perspective you view it however, he is constantly learning and understanding more about himself as much as he understands the system. That's his journey. He knows that he entered the Battle School willingly, perhaps in order to understand himself, though he may grow to hate it. In this way, it should have been clear to him from the start that it is meant to crush him. Because he strives to understand things, because at heart he is pure. He wants to learn, to understand, and to love.But he will also crush that which he loves if he allows himself to be pushed by the wrong people. Ender is easily manipulated because of his willingness and desire to understand, and in this way, he perhaps retains a bit of his childhood innocence. He is not completely naive however, and his most brutal actions are either committed out of frustration in not being able to understand or not being able to communicate on the same level--this is consequentially the same plight the Formics faced in their first dealings with the human race, and so it comes as no surprise that Ender is able to relate to them.Above all, it hits on some age-old questions. Why can't we communicate with each other? Why can we not understand? And is it sometimes futile to attempt to understand? For when you believe you have the answer to everything, it's not always so obvious as you thought. Can evil actions be justified in the name of self-preservation and war? What happens to soldiers when the war and its intensity are over, how can they re-adjust from such a grueling life, and how can they live with the lives they have taken?There are many questions this book both asks and answers, and of course such answers will all depend on how you are able to reorient yourself in a zero-gravity environment. This book has made me look at life and human interaction in a very different way, and despite that I may not agree with the author's personal views, I can sure appreciate his talent in crafting such a great story...especially one that renews and strengthens my own desire to both understand and love that which I've hated most.I was absolutely obsessed with this story, and I'll definitely be purchasing the rest in the series.",

And they are equipped with starships more powerful than Valkyrie. A direct fight would be hopeless, so the Pirates must rely on wacky ideas from the mushy brain of a monkey—and some serious sketchiness.\nThe Expeditionary Force saga continues in book 19 from epic sci-fi writer Craig Alanson and narrated by none other than R.C. Bray.",

        "reviewDescription": "*Original review on Goodreads and My Blog*EXCERPT*Silent, she waits for the sky to fall, standing upon an island of volcanic rock amidst a black sea. The long moonless night yawns before her. The only sounds, a flapping banner of war held in her lover's hand and the warm waves that kiss her steel boots. Her heart is heavy. Her spirit is wild. Peerless knights tower behind her. Salt spray beads on their family crests--emerald centaurs, screaming eagles, gold sphinxes, and the crowned skull of her father's grim house. Her Golden eyes look to the heavens. Waiting. The water heaves in. Out. The heartbeat of her silenceEND EXCERPT*So much of this book was me talking out loud to Darrow. Mainly, \"What are you doing?\"Obviously, I'm not going to spoil anything with all of that stuff.All of my babies are having babies =) Well, two of them more so than others. I wouldn't expect less of those two =)Some of the main characters that came back took a little bit of a backseat to some new characters. And when I think I might find one I'm going to love, they get killed so what's the point. Although, I really want to see what's going to be up with Tongueless. I'm very intrigued by him.I did fall in love with Lyria. Her story starts out horrible right from the start. I felt really bad for her. And even though she does some dumb things, I think she's learning and going to be a great character. At least she better be!I know some people might be upset over someone's death in the book but for some reason I don't think it really happened. Pierce Brown doesn't usually do it so calmly and by that I mean, sort of push it off to the side and moving on. Nope. It didn't happen. We shall see in Sept!!!!Yes! PB is the man! Who puts out the second book of the trilogy in the same year! THE MAN that's who. Now watch, I just jinxed it!Anyway, we have some other characters come back from the original trilogy and take a front seat. They were good but all I wanted to focus on was Sevro and Darrow. I love Sevro so much and I'm so afraid something is going to happen in the next two books or at the end of the third one. Pierce Brown you better not! I have so many scenario's in my head that I can even think straight. But, it will be what it will be.This book is more of a picking up after the wars sort of book. You have some people that were lied to, you have some people that turned traitor, you have people that keep doing stupid things, you have other people that do more stupid things. You have people being set on fire. That was fun. Evil person gets set on fire. We have underwater stuff that I thought was cool. We have some blood and gore as usual. Not tons but still. I'm not sure Darrow taking on an evil person to help him take another person out was such a good idea, but it worked. Now lets just see what havoc they are going to start in the next book. Or they could just sit on one of the planets and be all nice. Right!!Either way, I loved the book. I loved being with my peeps again. I actually want Sevro and Victra to have their own book with some of the howlers in it with them. They need to have their own planet and just do the crazy things they do =)I really, really, really hope Darrow comes to his senses. What is wrong with you Darrow?I just don't know what to do with that ending. I hope it's going to end well and maybe Darrow knows something we don't know. I feel like I don't know who he is and I felt that way in the very beginning. We shall see...Happy Reading!Mel ♥",

This was the start of different POV’s and I was skeptical at first but they were SO well done and tied perfectly together near the end. This was another great read, I feel the pacing was a bit off at times but it’s Pierce Brown so… can’t ever be below 4 stars.. 🤷‍♂️But as per usual… there is death and it is NOT for the weak. This book feels more of a setup for the next two, and it felt a bit slower than the other ones, more for character development and world building, which shined in this! All in all another BANGER of a book and can’t wait to read the next one! (Even though I’ve heard they are devastating…)",

        "reviewDescription": "2023-07-18I remember feeling trepidation when Iron Gold was first announced. Trepidation that, I now believe, Pierce Brown himself felt as well. A continuation of Red Rising... The trilogy felt like such a complete package that I was worried Pierce didn't have more story to tell, or that he was forcing a continuation due to the success of the first three books. Oh, how wrong I was.Iron Gold, especially on a reread, in many ways feels like a necessity. An inevitability, even. Something that the original trilogy was leading toward all along. The book begins with a ten year time jump, and it reinvigorates the series on almost every level. It changes the stakes, the circumstances, and the passage of time is believable, something Pierce has always excelled at. This change to our setting, along with our new POV characters, injects something into the series that I didn't even know it needed until it was there. It's hard to quantify, but it's in the pages.The tragedy of the first trilogy is that after everything that Darrow and his allies did, after all they sacrificed to break the chains of the Society, all it gained them was war. That is what Iron Gold shows us. A Republic that has been at war for ten long years, harried by remnants of the Society at every turn, knowing no peace, even for their victory. And it is how Darrow fits within the Republic he helped build (or rather, how he doesn't fit) that makes the continuation of the series so interesting. As I said, Darrow's path here feels like some tragic inevitability. Just, as I hope, his redemption will be...The character work remains excellent here, and Pierce has expanded the story from one first-person point-of-view to four. Not everyone was on board for this, but I find it brilliant. It felt natural to me, expanding the breadth of Pierce's storytelling and allowing him to showcase how his writing skill has evolved since he began. I think that a full trilogy of just Darrow was actually too much Darrow, in a way. Not because you got sick of him, but because he is so cool, such a great character, that depriving you of him, even if just for a handful of chapters, makes him that much more effective once he returns.Iron Gold is in many ways a herald of the Dark Age to come. Just as, one hopes, Light Bringer will be a tonal reprieve. It's just over the horizon now, and I can't wait to begin.“This is not the end. I loved you before I ever met you. I will love you until the sun dies. And when it does, I will love you in the darkness.\"2018-01-27A few years ago I bought a book called Red Rising by Pierce Brown for 99 cents. I'd heard good things, and what's a dollar for a book? It turned out to be one of the best dollars I ever spent as my fervor for the story led me to buying Golden Son. That book earned the series and its characters a spot among my favorites, and resulted in both my brother and father diving into the series. It led to a brutal wait for Morning Star for all of us, then to excitement over the possibility that Pierce would continue the story later in the timeline, which led to a brutal wait for the fourth book in the saga and thus, Iron Gold.I will not be posting any blatant spoilers for the book below, however if you've not ready any of the other books and would like to remain in the dark about who lives through the initial trilogy, I would skip this review.The Red Rising saga is like coming home for me. Its world and its characters hold a special place and sinking back into the story was easy and comfortable. Pierce Brown changes things up this time in that we no longer have a single narrator in Darrow. Instead he is joined by three other POV characters, making this one of the only first-person books I've ever read that has multiple points of view. I had some initial trepidation about this approach, but it was unwarranted. Pierce handled it extremely well, and each character had their own distinct voice.Seeing Darrow again was like hanging out with an old friend, and my heart breaks for him. To witness his efforts and sacrifices in the initial trilogy earn him nothing but war and strife was very hard, but I am impressed that even after four books Darrow is still growing, with room to grow further still. Lyria, our only truly brand new character, was a joy. And in a way she reminded me of Eo, the catalyst of the entire series. Amazing that a rebellion begun in her name could spawn so many more people just like her. Ephraim was a worthy POV character, offering the Gray perspective and tying in nicely with Lyria's story. He is another victim of the Rising, and lost much to Darrow's rise. You can't help but feel his nihilism and depression is justified. Finally, our last POV character (and the only one I knew we'd be reading before the book's release) was Lysander. Heir of Empire, grandson of Octavia au Lune and Lorn au Arcos, and godson of Magnus au Grimmus, the Ash Lord. I was most looking forward to reading Lysander's chapters, and they did not disappoint, easily taking the spot of my favorite. The story in the Rim is incredibly compelling, and House Raa with their code of Honor over vanity and excess (so atypical of Gold society) is admirable. Diomedes au Raa has the potential to become my favorite character of this series. Beyond our POV characters it was satisfying to reunite with other old friends like Sevro, Mustang, the Telemanuses, and many more.Characters aside (if you can't tell I think Pierce excels there) the pacing and story were true to form. Iron Gold is no different than the other Red Rising books in that it is damn hard to put down. Twists and turns abound, and by the end it's clear that this is just a new beginning. The Dark Age comes. Now we must see how our characters will meet it. I couldn't more pleased with this new installment, and with Pierce's progression as a writer. Luckily, I believe that the fifth book is due out this year as well, a welcome surprise. I cannot wait.LUX EX TENEBRISHail Libertas. Hail Reaper.",

Also since there was a bit of time between the 3rd and the 4th book, I had forgotten a lot of the names and events that happened so I was occasionally confused while reading it. Not a bad book of course, kept me interested.Excited to see how it ends!",

Read a lot of reviews before picking this up and continuing on from the original 3 lots were negative. It introduces other perspectives while still continuing with Darrow and i loved it.It makes the story have so much more depth and you find out how darrows choices have effected others all the other stories going on here are great. In short I was expecting it to be a disappointment but it absolutely was not.This series had my hooked from the first sentence in the first book and this one is no exception.",

        "reviewTitle": "Gripping and Thoughtful",
        "reviewDescription": "Starship Troopers is an amazing novel and almost nothing like that abortion of a movie by Verhoeven, who thought Heinlein a Neo-Fascist. That’s his depiction in the movie, but it doesn’t resemble the novel except very superficially. Frankly, it’s a scandal that a man was given the job of directing the adaptation to intentionally smear the novel, its ideas, and the man, himself.  But, on to the novel...It’s vintage Heinlein—imaginative, but with a tangible flavor of realism and an accurate anthropology. The characters are well-developed and the action satisfying. One of the unique things about Heinlein is his strong sense of the moral and an interesting aspect of this novel, in particular, is the political moral philosophy that underpins it—the notion that the only people that should have political power (the voter franchise) are those that have demonstrated the moral commitment of sacrifice for society—indeed, the human race. That is, those unwilling to put society above their own interests are unfit to wield political power, which amounts to the authority to wield force and violence. Philosophers and theologians have observed similar things. For example, Martin Luther’s concept of the Left-Hand Kingdom, asserts similar concepts—the State wields the sword for the benefit of society (and, for Luther, The Church) to create order and protect people from chaos and threats. Heinlein has his own twist on these ideas. They’re intriguing—and, convincing.It’s also my understanding that this is the first Sci-Fi novel to realistically depict military life. I can’t say for sure, because I have an insufficient understanding of the Sci-Fi cannon and I’ve never served in the military. Heinlein did know military life, as he graduated from the US Naval Academy and served 5 years as a naval officer before being retired because of an illness—tuberculosis, I believe.  All I can say is that it is believable. It doesn’t just focus on the actions and action, but the inner life, attitudes, and thought patterns of the military man (and woman). Needless to say, the movie completely misses the mark on this point also.I first read this novel decades ago and thought it terrific then—well, no surprise there, since it won the Hugo Award before the award was infested by political correctness. I thought it worth a re-read, especially in today’s political climate—the ideas here won’t be popular with people who think that government (really, other people) owes them free stuff. Even after decades, there were certain scenes that had stuck in my mind all that time. If you believe that the mark of a successful novel is its ability to stick in your mind, then this novel delivers in spades. Still, after reading it again I was surprised by how many substantive things I had forgotten, which is a testament to its depth.Originally marketed as one of Heinlein’s juvenile novels, it really doesn’t fit well in that genre. It’s shorter than many of his novels, but not as short as the juveniles such as “Have Spacesuit, Will Travel” (my favorite Heinlein novel of that genre). This is a serious book that explores serious ideas, so adults will find it satisfying. Nevertheless, I do recommend it for young adults. We’d do well to make it a regular part of the literature cannon taught in late middle school and high school, as it forces one to think about the relationship between responsibilities and rights, as well as economic concepts such as “value” and markets. If people are to be voting citizens, then they should be familiar with the ideas in this novel, even if they ultimately disagree with them. You can’t have a useful opinion on the concepts, though, if you don’t know what they are. Thinking about ideas is never a waste.",

        "reviewDescription": "I first read “Starship Troopers” when it was first published in 1959, right after I graduated from high school. Now, 64 years later, I have read it once more. I am a retired submarine officer who came up through the ranks like Rico. As I look back on my life through the lens of this remarkable book, I can see that it played a significant role in who I became.Some critics have panned “Starship Troopers” as nothing more than a series of civics infodumps interspersed with a thin storyline. While I understand where they come from, I disagree with that characterization. From what I know about Heinlein (I never met him), he led the libertarian wing of hard science fiction throughout the 50s, 60s, and 70s. He had a keen understanding of what Ayn Rand called the “Objective Universe.” He saw what had happened to the United States in his time (the 1950s), compared with what the founders had created. With insight clearer than virtually anyone else back then, he saw how things could be. “Starship Troopers” is a novel that shows exactly how his vision might be realized. He didn’t tell us how to do it, but rather showed us what it would be like if we did it. Throughout the novel, he regales us with the thoughts of experts who expound to their captive students on their conception (and, of course, Heinlein’s conception) of what he calls “History and Moral Philosophy.” These lectures, that comprise an integral part of the novel, became the underpinnings of who I became as an officer and a man.As I look back on my life of 82 years, I can see how profoundly Heinlein’s “History and Moral Philosophy” affected me personally. Ironically, in my post-military career, I write hard science fiction. I do not consciously emulate Heinlein, but my award-winning writings have frequently been compared to his—something I take as a great compliment.The bottom line here is, no matter what you may have heard about “Starship Troopers,” read it, and you will gain a new perspective on how things are and how they might be. I highly recommend it without equivocation. It is one of the very best hard science fiction novels ever written.",

        "reviewDescription": "Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers has finally made it in ebook form to the kindle, i've been waiting for this for a while and having never read it before I can happily say it was worth the wait and I can see why to many it is a classic. Those of you who have seen the films (I love the first and detest the others) may have a vague idea of the plot but the films are a pale imitation missing so much the book has to offer.The story follows the career of Johnnie Rico as a Trooper for the federation in a far off fascist future. Despite being a military sci-fi novel it has a surprising amount of political commentary running throughout adding an interesting layer of depth that a lot of modern military sci-fi novels really lack. In the future the only people that can vote have to have worked for the federation to earn citizenship, they have to have earned the right and put the good of the whole above the individual but it's not that simple as Johnnie finds out.Though Rico's reason for joining started as a political choice it soon turns into the look at the life of a mobile infantry trooper, over half the book is about his training alone, about what really makes a soldier in the future. Most of the cadets don't make it through training, nevermind to serve their term to be citizens.The way Starship Troopers is written from Johnnies point of view makes everything remarkably clear as the poor lad is as confused about events as the reader so nothing is left unexplained yet it never gets bogged down or feels slow, it's all pretty engrossing.I think that's what was so good about it, yes the bug war is mentioned towards the end but there's no resolution. It's not a book about saving worlds, about good vs evil, there's no distinct point. Just a career view of a trooper in a politically different future. It's a fascinating read I recommend to any sci-fi fan.+ Interesting political sub theme.+ Rico's training is detailed.+ Well written universe, clear and concise.+ Interesting plot focus, a little different.",

Fits right in and gives more history and answered some questions. Held my interest as I devoured the pages.Overall I found this whole set hard to put down. Quality writing and interesting stories. Will probably read it all again in the future. I own more books from this author than any other writer and he has never left me hanging or disappointed. I did receive an ARC copy of this but still purchased the final set as it was very much worth.I anxiously await what Mr Bartlett will release next! Grab this for pennies. Worth much more than it costs. Hours and hours of escape and entertainment. Highly recommend!",

        "reviewDescription": "This Ixan series took me a long time to read. Lots of space battles, complex characters, twists and turns and plot developments… the beginning was a little hard for me to keep all the people/places separate.But the more I read, the more I could visualize the players.Pretty PG- almost no sexual innuendo and no sex scenes. Tons of aliens, both good and bad.Book 6? 8? had a storyline of discrimination/civil justice for all species. It was my least favorite of all the series. (I get enough of that fight in real life.)",

        "reviewTitle": "Perhaps a decent 3-book story, crammed into 10, with aliens and improbability throughout",
        "reviewDescription": "The first story-line pits good-guys vs bad guys; the second, exceptionally naïve bad guys that sort of become good vs really naïve bad guys; the third, can’t really sort them out.This is an interesting take on Space-Military. It starts with an amazing amount of rebellion, plus quite a bit of insubordination. The level of greed and corruption tends to exceed most of what I’ve seen in other Space Opera, even more than the majority of today’s corporate world. In doing so, it probably serves as a good example as how not to grow forward. At the start, most of the characters are pretty narrow. Their actions and reactions are pretty well expected.By the third book, it becomes pretty clear that the story is pretty shallow. Also, the grammar is weak. Personally, I believe those writing professionally should use proper grammar. Simple things, like using ‘him’ instead of ‘he’, should never be overlooked.The second story (4th book) pretty much leaves the previous story behind and picks up an offshoot. Like the first part of this series, the writing is pretty shallow and quite redundant. All the so-called action is so predictable, you sort of want to flip back in the books and try to match sentences. If it weren’t for blood-lust, there might not be much in this.Story 3 (starts with 8th book) After getting mid-way into this section of the series, I find it exceptionally difficult to keep reading. The story-line has digressed to a patently absurd set of circumstances and has exaggerated behaviors to a point that they are unbelievable. It is a struggle, but I went through to the (bitter) end.Overall, an OK story. Way too long for the meat of the story; even more clueless characters than normal for Space Opera; a lot of just extra stuff. Not really ‘bad’, but a bit tiring to work through.",

I have found the book collection hard to put down since starting it. Every time I think I've found a decent place to stop for a while, it never fails to fall onto a plot twist or a cliff-hanger or some such writers ploy to keep you from doing just that! The story line has been growing more complex and far reaching as I have been reading (mid book 3 so far). I can't imagine what Scott has in store for us in the later stories but I am certainly looking forward to reading the remainder of this collection. Buying this collection - all ten books - for 99 cents was a crazy good deal. I send a huge thanks out to Scott for thinking of us readers!!! If it's still on sell for 99 cents, buy it for your home library. if not, consider buying it for your home library anyway. From what I've read so for, this collection qualifies as one you can come back to reread over and over again.",

        "reviewDescription": "There are things that good fiction does that are missing in bad. Let's look at Star Wars. EP4 starts in the middle of a chase. We get to know the characters osmoticly and everything looks used and worn out.Episode 1 everyone stops and introduces themselves, we get into the politics and the finances of the Republic. Everything is shiny and new.Good fiction shows you a slice of a wider world or universe but you sense the story was happening before you arrived and that it continued after. You know every dent and scratch had a tale but it wasn't as interesting as the tale you are seeing now.We join this book after one of the main protagonist has been busted down, after his father betrayed his people, after a Galactic war. Our hero ship is fighting decommissioning and represents older technology. Everything is running already, everyone has a story and all the bits are gradually revealed. We don't deep dive into every bit but we join a textured and thought out world at its most interesting point.The influences on this series are quite overt. First and foremost our hero ship is clearly an ersatz version of Battlestar Galactica, the wrong ship to be the last one standing but for that reason the only one that could. BSG, especially the reboot, comes up as an influence time and again. Next is Dune. Prophesy is nothing new but it hovering over the top feels very Dune like, but more than this the rejection of Hard AI feels like the Butlarian Jihad. Finally Star Trek in all of its guises hovers above this work, often as a counterpoint to it, making the humans in this series the dark shadow to its light.None of this influences are plagiarism and none of them detract from it. This is a fantastic book series which calls on some great source material and then puts a totally new spin on it. This is original, exciting, creative and populated with some hugely compelling characters and ships.Very highly recommended and I want to see a lot more from this author.",

        "reviewDescription": "This 6th chapter in the I, Starship series of novels continues the excellent character development of Sgt. Henry Morgan.  Capt. Seemey has evolved from a pompous ass to a proper starship captain who willingly accepts and depends on Henry for survival of the UES Interchange.  As they struggle to unite the various surviving factions, a new and infinitely more dangerous foe approaches.  I read this book over the weekend, and couldn't put it down!  This is the perfect setup for the next book.  I know this book (6) just came out, but I'm so excited to read book 7, I'm starting to vibrate.  You must release book 7 now, before I destroy the fabric of time!",

Scott has come up with some amazingly complex and fascinating alien cultures that Seemey and Morgan encounter as their mission continues. One race in particular gets focus as the story unfolds, and Scott's imagination shines as he portrays this race of beings. This mission takes place in a new star system, and the crew run into the Cats and Coalition again upon coming out of offset. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and definitely recommend it!",

The trip will take months just to travel one way. They pick up some skilled mechanics and what they assume will be plenty of spare parts.Unfortunately, what they discover will require more than they brought with them.They find a war-ravaged planet, where the survivors are reduced to jungle-dwelling primitives, and the remaining AIs are intent on exterminating all the surviving aliens.",

    "bookDescription": "A Horus Heresy Novel\nHorus has revealed his dark plans, but nobody is prepared for just how far he will go. The force sent to end the Warmaster's rebellion doesn't realise they are heading towards a slaughter unlike anything the galaxy has seen.\nLISTEN TO IT BECAUSE\nIt's the deepest exploration so far of one of the most horrific battles of the Horus Heresy. You may know what happened during the Dropsite Massacre, but you don't know it all. It's far worse than you thought as the treachery is revealed.\nTHE STORY\nHorus has rebelled against the Emperor by purging his and his brother's Legions, but what was supposed to be a secret act of murder has been revealed. In the Emperor's name, Rogal Dorn and Malcador the Sigillite dispatch the largest force of legionaries and primarchs ever assembled to end Horus' rebellion before it can begin.\nBut the loyalists, on their way to enact vengeance, do not know the depth of the betrayal they face. They will not be the perpetrators of a massacre, but its victims. The last hope of returning to the Great Crusade and the unity of the Imperium will die in the dust of Isstvan V, and those who survive will live in a new age of darkness.\nWritten by John French. Narrated by Jonathan Keeble. Runtime 11 hours and 27 minutes approx.",

        "reviewDescription": "This was the one story that needed telling in more detail than any other of the other horus heresy events, and oh boy, does John French deliver!John French does a superb job of laying out all of the details and characters that made up this event, such as why and how Horus achieved such a near complete victory over three legions. Who let's not forget, in their very own rite, are exceptionally accomplished legions that are led by highly intellectual and tactical leaders. The groundwork laid out before, and the amount of forethought gone into such an ambush was very fulfilling to witness.I also enjoyed seeing from the the other point of view as to why the retaliatery force attacked them way they did, they didn't just charge in  with no plan, it was carefully considered from all angles.Overall, this really felt like a story told not just to the fans of the series but also to those who would like to witness firsthand how this momentous event took place.",

        "reviewDescription": "Disappointed in this book.GW seem to have an issue with books tied to miniature edition releases (this i assume for Saturnine) as they always appear rushed. This book is no exception. It should either have been 2-3 books getting into the full detail of the lead up to and execution of Istvann V or a single book this length focused on the Primarchs of both sides.This book falls between the two, the bits on the Primarchs are interesting (especially the Alpha Legion) but don't seem enough, especially the Loyalist ones - Ferrus Mannus and his Legion deserve a lot more background. The story threads following the new characters feel rushed and shallow, including the now obligatory super competent generic female General/Admiral/Captain to ensure boxes are ticked.I normally enjoy this authors books and would recommend his other ones to readers but sadly dont feel this one is up to previous publications.",

    "bookDescription": "After a risky hyperspace jump, Captain Archer Devereaux arrives in an uninhabited sector of the Orion Spur.He finds a long-abandoned ship with technology far advanced beyond any known in his region of space. Even more puzzling, the ship is of human construction. As the ship regains functionality, traps left by mutineers threaten the lives of Archer and the tiny crew aboard the derelict.When he succeeds in bringing Defender back to Alliance space, an idealistic scientist posts critical information regarding Defender’s advanced technology. The Nemeans and Scyllans press for peace talks—a delaying tactic while they evaluate the information dump. When they learn that implementation is at least a year away, they break the truce violently, attempting to capture the Alliance and EU delegates during peace talks on Earth.Archer suffers devastating losses in the attack, which he has difficulty processing emotionally. Bette has her own issues of this type, and the two part on uncertain terms. She then disappears, leaving a cryptic note.Defender’s Awakening is a pulse-pounding space opera of interstellar intrigue, moral dilemmas, and fragile emotional bonds. It’s perfect for fans of epic sci-fi adventures, where heroes must not only battle their foes but also control their hearts.Book 4 of a new military science fiction series from award-winning author John J. Spearman. It's perfect for fans of Rick Partlow, Nathan Lowell, and Jeffery H. Haskell!",

    "bookDescription": "The New York Times bestselling origin story of the Master Chief—part of the expanded universe based on the award-winning video game series Halo!The twenty-sixth century. Humanity has expanded beyond Earth’s system to hundreds of planets that colonists now call home. But the United Earth Government and the United Nations Space Command is struggling to control this vast empire. After exhausting all strategies to keep seething colonial insurrections from exploding into a full-blown interplanetary civil war, the UNSC has one last hope. At the Office of Naval Intelligence, Dr. Catherine Halsey has been hard at work on a top-secret program that could bring an end to the conflict…and it starts with seventy-five children, among them a six-year-old boy named John. And Halsey could never guess that this child will eventually become the final hope against an even greater peril engulfing the galaxy—the inexorable confrontation with a theocratic military alliance of alien races known as the Covenant. This is the electrifying origin story of Spartan John-117—the Master Chief—and of his legendary, unstoppable heroism in leading the resistance against humanity’s possible extinction.",

The fast-paced, pulse-pounding, action-oriented structure doesn't waste any time and gets right into the meat of the story. There are the necessary slower scenes that keep the pace in check and help develop the characters, but this book focuses on the action, and I love it. There aren't many authors willing to do that.In all honesty, I expected a lot more fluff. But that's not what this book is about. It's about brutal training, boots-on-the-ground action, and a coming-of-age story in which John learns the price of leadership and the cost of victory.This book is brilliant, and I'd recommend it to anyone. Even if you haven't played the Halo games, give this book a shot.",

        "reviewDescription": "Halo:The Fall of Reach is a book that tells the story before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved, the video game.  This story entails the story of the SPARTAN projects and does so very well. I am not going to get into the details because that is what the book is for and I dare not ruin any of the story or the history revealed.This book is very very well written, and the way the action plays out is simply amazing.  The story is extravigant and it fills in the holes and answers some of the questions people have if you start with the game like I did.This novel actually made me go back and play through Halo: Combat Evolved again because Master Chief is amazing, and the holes this novel filled in terms of character is awe inspiring.The only reason that this magnificient novel did not get a perfect five star rating is because from a critical standpoint, the grammer sucked.  For a published work in which one has an editor and the book should be proof read, there were an outragous amount of spelling errors and even a mix up in the letters of a name.  To the credit of the author the errors do not impede on the story they just make one look twice.  They were not so outragous where you could not tell what the author was saying and there was no fragments.hope this helps it is a great book and if you are a fan of Halo read this, play the first game again (skip HALO: THE FLOOD, caus that book is basically the game but less fun), and read HALO: FIRST STRIKE",

        "reviewTitle": "Gripping account of humanity in peril",
        "reviewDescription": "If I said I haven’t read much sci-fi since I was a teenager I’d be lying because in the last year I’ve read ten novels in The Expanse series (and watched the TV series on Amazon Prime). Then I started watching the Halo series on Amazon Prime and decided to read this book, not realising that there are about twenty volumes in the Halo series, written by different authors. Very much a team effort, like the Spartans, who are the elite super-soldiers protecting us from the Covenant – the evil aliens who want to wipe out humanity.First, let me offload some gripes and prejudices. According to the “fore world”, this book was conceived and written in four months – and it shows. In some places the writing is a bit sloppy. We’re told several times that the Spartans have standing orders to seize any alien technology they can get their hands on. Fine. We only needed to hear that once. Every chapter begins with a precise location and date for the action, down to the exact hour, yet despite that the author and the backup team manage to lose a decade during the course of the novel. John – the Master Chief – and the other Spartans are kidnapped as six-year-olds in 2517. The main action takes place in 2552. According to my arithmetic that’s 35 years later, yet a key character is convinced that the gap is only 25 years. It means that characters are ten years older than the author apparently thinks. We have senior officers calling John “son” when he’s 41 years old, which is really really patronising given his martial prowess! Remember, he and his comrades performed their first successful mission against the aliens as 14-year-olds. Another gripe – or prejudice – is that the prevailing culture in 2552 is pure American. This novel seems to have been written in 2001. Twenty-odd years later, the chances of the US providing the dominant culture over the next five hundred years seem increasingly remote. Specifically, we’re given a “Pentagon” culture that in many ways feels a bit like the US in the 1960s Vietnam rather than the twenty-first, never mind, the twenty-sixth century. I say that because despite some notable victories, humanity is losing this war against the Covenant, and the top brass are getting increasingly desperate. One more gripe is about technology. As in The Expanse series, we have a strange mix of futuristic technology (spaceships that can travel in another dimension and colonisation of distant planets) and contemporary hardware (guns that fire bullets, electric cars). There is AI but even the most sophisticated AI beings are only there to assist humans. They haven’t taken over yet. You can’t help wondering why all the fighting isn’t being done by drones and robots and these AI beings rather than by people. But that’s the problem: if the available technology was used to its fullest extent this would be a novel about machines rather than about humans.Having said all that, the novel is an enjoyable piece of escapism with some great action and some genuinely compelling characters. There’s Dr Catherine Halsey, the enigmatic genius scientist who conceived the Spartan programme. We’ve not been told anything about her origins in this volume, maybe that will come later, but she has a brilliant mind and she seems to be committed to saving humanity from destruction – by any means necessary. John, who becomes leader of the Spartans, is shown as flawed and vulnerable. He’s not the biggest, fastest or strongest Spartan, but he has deeper qualities that make him the natural leader. Then we have the AI, Cortana, who turns out to be a very human piece of software. And Captain Jacob Keyes, the pipe-smoking officer who does what Admiral Horatio Nelson in another war said we should all do – our “duty”.I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys science fiction or action and adventure stuff. I understand that this is not the first Halo novel to be written but it is some kind of prequel, so I’m wondering which way to go next. I will definitely read more Halo novels.",

A fun afternoon and good enough that I bought the next book and will start reading after I close this off.  There is a lot of awesome character development potential here, and I hope this story is just the beginning of an excellent series.This is the first and only book I've read by Kevin Hardman, so far.",

        "reviewDescription": "Terminus: Fringe Worlds #1, my tenth read/listen from author Kevin Hardman & the first book in a series that looks to be excellent! I don't restrict my reading to any particular genre. Instead, I'm a sucker for anything with memorable characters & a story that keeps me on the edge of my seat until the end. Reminiscent of Michael Anderle & Sarah Noffke’s Ghost Squadron series and Isaac Hooke’s Forever Gate series. Narrator Mikael Naramore’s talented narration added greatly to the book’s enjoyment. I was given an Audible copy of this book & am voluntarily reviewing it. Since I own both the Kindle & Audible edition I was able to follow along while being read to. I have to admit there were times I sped up the book because I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Different than his Kid Sensation series I’ll be reading more from this author & look forward to the rest of the series! (RIP Marley January 20, 2014 - July 24, 2018).",

        "reviewDescription": "Suprising plot line, this went places that I did not see coming and is very well written and the editing is superb. No spoilers here but a particularly nasty and deadly alien race on the outer fringes of known space, secret mission out to investigate and a tough, but fair protaganist that I would follow into battle myself.  This is the first of a series evidently. Could be a standalone book and thankfully does not end on a cliffhanger- ugh, I hate those. Great story, extremely captivating and entertaining.I highly recommend this book and this talented author. I look forward to reading more in this series.",

    "bookDescription": "Red Rising hit the ground running and wasted no time becoming a sensation. Golden Son continues the stunning saga of Darrow, a rebel forged by tragedy, battling to lead his oppressed people to freedom.\nAdapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music!\nAs a Red, Darrow grew up working the mines deep beneath the surface of Mars, enduring backbreaking labor while dreaming of the better future he was building for his descendants. But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow’s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds—and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within.\nA lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love—but also the wrath of powerful rivals. To wage and win the war that will change humankind’s destiny, Darrow must confront the treachery arrayed against him, overcome his all-too-human desire for retribution—and strive not for violent revolt but a hopeful rebirth. Though the road ahead is fraught with danger and deceit, Darrow must choose to follow Eo’s principles of love and justice to free his people.\nHe must live for more.\nPerformed by Full Cast; Stewart Crank, Jenna Sharpe, Jon Vertullo, Ian Russell, Richard Rohan, Julie-Ann Elliott, Andrew James Spooner, Laura C. Harris, Kay Eluvian, Amanda Forstrom, Andy Clemence, Bradly Foster Smith, Chris Davenport, Colleen Delany, Danny Gavigan, David Cui Cui, David Engel, Dylan Lynch, Elena Anderson, Elizabeth Jernigan, Eric Messner, Gabriel Michael, Holly Adams, Ian Putnam, James Konicek, John Kielty, Julie Hoverson, Karen Novak, Ken Jackson, Lucy Symons, Marni Penning, Matthew Bassett, Michael John Casey, Mike Carnes, Nanatte Savard, Nazia Chaudhry, Nhea Durrosseau, Nicole Perez, Peter Stray, Rana Kay, Scott McCormick, Shanta Parasuraman, Stephanie Németh-Parker, Steve Wannall, Todd Scofield, Wyn Delano, Yasmin Tuazon and Zeke Alton.",

Retta's network reveals a threat rising in Europe, as various nations struggle to break free of earth, make bonds among the stars, and find new and exciting ways to turn the planet into something to be packaged and sold.For a profit, of course.Earth isn't the only world in danger, and a mystery in deepest space brings a strange connection to Perry's past—one that will unlock a second front on Van's war, all while opening the crew up to danger rooted in the halls of Anvil Dark.Anvil Dark, and the GKU aren't allies, not really, and Van is faced with old enemies and new recruits in a dirty fight for control of something that should belong to everyone—the law. Using technocrats, criminals, and opportunists, Van's enemies have bought their way into an alliance that will push the Fafnir and her crew into a battle for the ultimate control of earth's future——And the defense of earth will be waged as Van keeps one eye on deepest space, where an ancient enemy has awakened, eager for vengeance. Eager for the end of all life.And eager to end the Tudor line, once and for all.",

Chaney has a habit of doing that.After a couple of false starts with this story arc, which began with the orginal crew's adult kids being shoved to the forefront (not very interesting), things are back on track here.  Thankfully, Van, Torina, Perry,  Icky, Funboy and freinds are (mostly)  in charge for this big finale.  Which involves bad guys from the earliest books of the series.  Still, it is clear the series will continue, since there is a setup for new story arc at the very end.",

    "bookDescription": "Book 1 in the Scouring SeriesAs the Siege of Terra ends, there are many loose ends – Traitors trying desperately to escape, a monumental vacuum of power to fill, and a crumbling galactic government to see to. Those who hold on to power must decide how to wield it, and a new structure must be put in place, all while desires to exact vengeance run high.READ IT BECAUSEIt's the beginning of an epic series. Find out what happens after the cataclysmic events of the Horus Heresy, as an unsteady Imperium must find its footing and learn how to exist without the guidance of the Emperor.THE STORYHorus is dead. Terra lies in ruins. The Emperor is silent. Amid the rubble of the Palace, shell-shocked survivors emerge into the light of an uncertain dawn. New powers are present now, ones that have travelled the length of the galaxy to bring salvation to the Imperium, though they are as readily cast as usurpers as redeemers. The survivors of the Traitors’ Grand Armada, now scattered and desperate to escape vengeance, are riven with doubt and dissension, and their gods too are silent. Amid all the grief and confusion, some hopeful souls believe the war to be over and an era of renewal just ahead. But wiser heads know that this war can never end, and that the only question remaining is who shall rise to power within the perilous new age, and who shall fall.Written by Chris Wraight.",

        "reviewTitle": "A deeply mixed bag with more bad than good...*SPOILERS*",
        "reviewDescription": "*SPOILER WARNING*First off, do not be fooled by the cover art. The book does feature a council of the Primarchs, and the High Lords of Terra, but it is astonishingly brief and does nothing but degrade the sensibilities of beloved characters. It would seem, to my mind, beyond certain that the loyalist sons would have the good sense - after a ruinous war of Heresy caused by their once-brother - not to argue and snipe with one another in front of the rest of the Imperial leaders when the dust had barely settled and the blood not yet dried. This is overestimating them, apparently.Despite neither the Siege of Terra V3 and Era of Ruin not featuring it - and it being arguably an incredibly important piece of lore for the reader to see and understand - AotI does not include a solo meeting/reunion of the Primarchs in the immediate aftermath of Horus' defeat. Nor does it feature any Primarch POV chapters. We do not get to see them collectively grieve, nor resolutely unite, after their Lord Father's gruesome downfall. This is a big misstep, in my opinion.On top of the omissions, the staggering bloat in this book, and sheer pointlessness of some of the subplots (I can't fathom why they included a Chaos Cultist's pointless flight across barren Terran plains in lieu of a Blood Angels POV about their fallen Lord), is matched only by the baffling fixation on minutia. There are parts of it that are about as thrilling to read as a cargo manifesto. Did any of the Black Library authors think that's what people who have stuck with the franchise for decades wanted to read about in such a rich and storied setting? This series is arguably more interesting than the Siege was, and yet they waste so much of its potential.Speaking of omissions; there are no Abaddon chapters, nothing whatsoever featuring Corax (bar a brief reference to his seat at the council being empty), nothing whatsoever about the White Scars except a brief appearance by their Primarch, nothing concerning Valdor that isn't just a passing comment, and nothing of note happens in respect of the Mechanicus/Mechanicum (no POV chapters). Worst of all, in my view, we don't get to read the perspective of any of the Ultramarines as they first landed on Terra to help lift the siege.All that being said; this book was clearly written with purpose. It is abundantly clear that Wraight has created a through-line between The Scouring and the current 40K timeline in that Guilliman is, for baffling reasons that might be why they've delayed his union with El'Jonson for so long, being set up as an Empire-stealing maniac whose actions might spark a civil war.It also seems, in my view at least, to have been purposely crafted with just enough hints and bread-crumbs about larger in-universe implications to get LoreTubers churning out endless content about it over one single line of text.With those considerations in mind; it is a well-written book, and it does move the 30K timeline forward slightly. It is just, perhaps, one only for the purist collectors and setting enthusiasts. In my opinion, it does not provide enough substance to justify the price.Bought on Kindle.",

    "bookDescription": "When Earth's colonies go silent, Legion Varus drops onto Kepler-62 expecting a routine investigation. Instead, they find something far worse than death.\nThe colonists aren't dead—they're changed. A new kind of enemy has arrived in Province 921, microscopic invaders that transform humans into perfectly coordinated killing machines. These \"Demon\" parasites don't just control minds; they improve them, creating an army that works with terrifying efficiency.\nAs cities fall and soldiers turn against their own, Centurion James McGill discovers he's mysteriously immune to infection. But immunity comes with a price. To save humanity from becoming pawns of a new Galactic species, McGill must navigate a web of seduction, betrayal, and impossible choices.\nSome invasions come with warships. Others come with a whisper, a touch, and a promise of something better. The question is: what happens when the enemy might be right?\nDemon World is an action-packed entry in B.V. Larson's bestselling Undying Mercenaries series.",

That really seemed to be something obvious and avoidable; the pattern was always to make any infringement destroyable, renounceable, or deniable!This may not change everything, but it changes a lot. The new storyline offers a lot, and it's extremely unsettling.I do hope we get a cloud city, maybe suspended from a moon into a gas giant? There was a book written by an author who committed suicide because he thought he was a failure, because his publisher didn't tell him how well he was selling. I don't recall his name offhand, but his stories really were good, and Baen picked up rights to republish. I think he had one, about Earth sending indestructible robots to explore Jupiter, and Jupiter's native species deciding on peace because it. I think a nod to that could work really well with the big guy!",

    "bookDescription": "On a mountainside at the edge of the Kaigenese Empire live the most powerful warriors in the world, superhumans capable of raising the sea and wielding blades of ice. For hundreds of years, the fighters of the Kusanagi Peninsula have held the Empire's enemies at bay, earning their frozen spit of land the name \"The Sword of Kaigen\".\nBorn into Kusanagi's legendary Matsuda family, f14-year-old Mamoru has always known his purpose: To master his family's fighting techniques and defend his homeland. But when an outsider arrives and pulls back the curtain on Kaigen's alleged age of peace, Mamoru realizes that he might not have much time to become the fighter he was bred to be. Worse, the empire he was bred to defend may stand on a foundation of lies.\nMisaki told herself that she left the passions of her youth behind when she married into the Matsuda house. Determined to be a good housewife and mother, she hid away her sword, along with everything from her days as a fighter in a faraway country. But with her growing son asking questions about the outside world, the threat of an impending invasion looming across the sea, and her frigid husband grating on her nerves, Misaki finds the fighter in her clawing its way back to the surface.\nWhen the winds of war reach their peninsula, will the Matsuda family have the strength to defend their empire? Or will they tear each other apart before the true enemies even reach their shores?",

        "reviewDescription": "It has been a very long time since a book floored me like this. And of those books that have affected me, I don't think any other book has ever resonated this much with me on a personal level. In full disclosure, this may be due to my timing of reading this book while going through my own personal issues. But then again, this book still made me question the power of the universe by coming into my life at this particular time. A little over two years ago, I challenged myself to start reading more and mainly what I wanted to read were sci-fi and fantasy novels. At the start of researching the books I wanted to read; The Sword of Kaigen was always at the very top of everyone's lists. Despite its (very well deserved) high praise, I held off reading it for a very long time. I don't know why. I was either not ready to read to something so \"heavy,\" or I doubted that the book could live up to expectations. I was wrong on both counts.The Sword of Kaigen is an incredible human story wrapped in a fantasy adventure. The story mainly follows one family's struggle to protect its village from outside forces and the changing of the times. What makes this book so special are the family dynamics and how they're presented and developed over the course of the book. While the world-building and action are on par with any other great fantasy adventure, the character work and development are uniquely masterful in this book.The author's delicate exploration of the meaning of family, grief, identity, emotional growth, and resilience in the face of devastating hopelessness, places this novel among literary greats, and takes it well beyond its categorizing as a \"standalone epic fantasy adventure.\" There isn't much more I can say about this book because I don't have the ability to articulate my feelings into words on the level this book deserves. All I can say is that, if you've ever loved someone in any capacity, then you should read this book.My final point is simply a personal and selfish lament that the author chose to discontinue this series (for now). As a fan of the book, I would love nothing more than to continue following some of these characters in future stories. But I understand and respect the author's decision. As an ardent fan of this particular book, I very much appreciate that experiencing its greatness is now increased by that fact that it is a standalone, one-off, great novel. There are no sequels to Blood Meridian or Of Mice and Men, and I am OK with that too.",

        "reviewDescription": "This book left me completely torn—part of me loved it, and part of me wanted to throw it across the room. Wang's storytelling ability is undeniably solid, and I was captivated by the dual POV between mother and son. The way they barely knew each other despite sharing lives was both heartbreaking and sweet.But here's where I hit a wall: I could not understand the main character's motivations. We're supposed to believe that this incredibly strong, highly educated, talented woman—who grew up treated as an equal, had loving relationships, and seemingly everything anyone could want—would walk away from it all to throw herself into years of silent, obedient subjugation? She went from crime-fighting vigilante—basically Batman—to meek doormat because her misguided father commanded it?I see the appeal of that dramatic contrast, but it makes zero sense to me. If it was a cover for some deeper purpose, maybe. But she genuinely just turned off who she was because daddy said so.Maybe it's a cultural disconnect, but her self-inflicted personal subjugation frustrated me beyond belief. I just don’t believe this character would act that way. I almost feel like writing some fan fiction to prove it to myself!But despite my frustration with this character - I will read whatever M.L. Wang produces. It really was a fantastic book overall.",

        "reviewTitle": "Simply stunning",
        "reviewDescription": "This book had me in awe by the end of the pages I am sad this is a stand alone in this universe. You follow a handful of characters all belonging to the same family and the story is told from their points of view as. I have honestly enjoyed stories written this way. It adds another layer of depth and complexity to bring ideas into the story. You can get more then just one POV in situations and it also just gives you more opportunity to grow a relationship with the characters.People have elemental powers similar to Avatar the last Airbender where people of certain regions or families have control over one aspect. They don't delve too deep into the magic of it all but I have always loved a supernatural edge to a story.You start following Mamoru a young warrior in training from a famous clan Matsuda. You also follow the perspective of his mother Misaki as well they seem to dominate a majority of the major views you see this world from.Following Mamoru you get the sense of a young boy is confident but trying his best to meet the expectations of his powerful and traditional father. He meets a new classmate who has joined his school and this boy eventually shakes the entire foundation of Mamoru's world with truths that have been hidden away for a long time in the remote village his clan resides in. Mamoru struggling with truths he has been taught his whole life and the groundbreaking evidence this boy shows him to start in motion Mamoru's first experience with grappling that he has been lied to his whole life. That his life and the lives of the people in his village serve a darker purpose then what their glorious history shrouds. In these moments of uncertainty Mamoru confides in his mother the revelations he has discovered.Misaki born in another area is privy to the truths that have been hidden from these people for so long but in this world the roles are very traditional so it is not for a woman to voice truths that would tear down the culture of this village of warrior clans. When Mamoru comes to her with his new knowledge of the real reason they have lived and kept the wrong knowledge passed down generation to generation Misaki is struck with the struggle of whether to completely tear the veil from his eyes. Misaki is struggling much with herself. Who she is compared to her younger years and who she had become. She is unhappy but devout in her duty to be a good mother and wife even though it has destroyed any part of who she was. She is lost and while her son is also experiencing that sense of loss she feels a small connection and starts to realize not what she had lost but what she had gained from a cold  and uncaring husband.The action in this story is intense. I lost myself everytime I picked the book up in the middle of the turmoil of the plot. There was no hesitating to make a great and heart wrenching scene no matter what characters it affected ( doing my best to avoid any spoilers I apologize about being so vague but you will see) I cried ALOT like just full on  sobbing I ot so attached to characters ot the scene was just so emotionally intense I could help but feel my lip tremble and tears slipping down my cheeks. My face was so sore by the end of it all!  And when it felt like I had to be close to the end I realized there was still about half of the book to go still.....oh how can this ever be a happy ending? My heart can't take it but I couldn't stop turning pages.After the major action finally calms and we come back to some semblance of normalcy we finally get a break through with Misaki and Takeru ( I will admit Takeru was not my favorite for a majority of the book but he was never so bad I hated his character he was so Stiff and Mean) this softened my heart to Takeru even the strongest have their hearts as well. You finally felt like in some way you could finally understand why he was the way he was and you could relate.The characters all struggle with inner strife finding who they are or accepting things for how they are. Accepting pain and facing it head on. Being true to yourself but also the ones you love and care for. All in all it's a beautiful story and I just wish it wasn't the END. It felt like there was a build up at the end that could have lead to another book maybe two but this is it and it makes me so sad to say goodbye to these characters so soon. What a great story and I just love the eastern theme of itThat said I have read that the other books in this world do not match up and it makes me hesitant to read them. And I do not think they take place in this time so things would be different I am sure. This book is a great read you'll enjoy it!!!!",

        "reviewDescription": "On the Physical Book:Sturdy and easy to handle. The paper selection could have opted for a paper quality that would allow a more flexible spine. The cover treatment is average, as the outer plastic film shows signs of peeling after a few days at the beach (under shade, no sun exposure).On the Story:The Sword of Kaigen (@mlwangauthor ) is a gut wrenching epic with an amazing set of character arcs with really cool development that show depth and uniqueness . The world building is detailed and immersive with good socio-political nuances. The magic system is well developed and easy to grasp and complements well a martial arts background.The Sword of Kaigen is sadly only 600+ pages and seems to be a standalone. My wish is that the author may eventually bless us with more incursions into Duna and the Matsudas.",

        "reviewTitle": "Powerful and Emotional, Though the Ending Falters",
        "reviewDescription": "The Sword of Kaigen is a deeply moving standalone fantasy. The slow beginning worked perfectly for me, building up the family and setting so that when tragedy struck, it hit incredibly hard. The battle scenes are cinematic, but what truly stands out is the subtle emotional writing — a single quiet line of grief often carried more weight than pages of description.Where the book lost me was in the final act. After such an unforgettable middle, the story seemed to lose focus. The Robin subplot felt forced, and several loose ends felt bolted on, as if the author was preparing for sequels that never came. The wider political threads also faded away, leaving an ending that didn’t provide the closure I had hoped for.Still, this remains one of the most emotional and impactful fantasies I’ve read in a while, and I’d strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a standalone with real depth.",

        "reviewDescription": "Sometimes when I am about half-way through a book and I am reading something as powerful and impressive as this was, I have a fairly good idea what my review is going to be about. And at that half-way point, I did think I was going to write about the world building, and characterizations, magic and everything else that I found to be notable about this story.But, then I read the last half, and I can say that since reading Stephen King’s Wizard and Glass a few years back- I haven’t been so affected by a story as I was this one, or so emotionally invested in characters as these, that I cried through a good twenty percent of this book.See, I was expecting a regular epic-style fantasy, and when we had that amazing battle midway through, all I could think was holy crap, how is the author going to top this? And where can this possibly go from here with so many pages left? What I didn’t realize was, that the incredibly intense first half the book, was only part of the story and not even the best part.So, this stand-alone book works to set-up a little history of a country, and way of life of a people for a later series. While the front-half gives us this incredible world, people, and epic scale battle, the back-half deals with the aftermath, and is about a community finding strength to survive events that are just too horrifying to even imagine- surviving loss of everything from your loved ones to your home and livelihood. It’s about rebuilding and finding hope in each other, and coming together as people. But, at the core of all of that- was Misaki, and even though it was filled with a community of people that were just as full of life as her, this was really her story.Misaki was the heart of this book. She is a mother and wife, coming to terms with a life that maybe didn’t quite go the way she expected. Her story is about healing, regrets, grief, and feeling like you have no voice but also being scared to have one. And just as importantly, it’s about being responsible for your own happiness.Misaki’s journey is raw and painful but it’s also fulfilling and beautiful. As a mother, daughter and wife- her every fear, joy, and regret, resonated with me, and I applaud her characterisation. Without her this would have been a great book with some very cool fight scenes (I’m still in awe over the Matusda brother’s Ice Dragon) and a good solid base for a later series. With her though- it became an outstanding piece of storytelling that needs to be experienced, and one that is going to stick with me for a long time.Other Notes and small criticisms- Even with the huge amount of subtitled stuff I watch, which most of it is tv and film (where they sometimes tend to drop/change this sort of thing in favor of digestibility) and not print, it took me a while to keep the honorifics straight in my head. Particularly when there were a lot of different characters addressing one character. Misaki for instance, who is an elder, mother, and/or respected member of the community, has a different honor appropriate for each title depending on who is addressing her.There was a handy dandy glossary at the back of the book, which I did use once at the beginning, but kindle makes these things not the funnest things to flip back and forth between, so I rarely end up using them once I get going, and just rely on my bad memory for the rest of the book. Making this quibble more my problem than the authors’. Hey, I had to think of something to criticize.-The ending while I did like it giving Misaki a little closure, and setting up stuff for later books, I also felt it could have been trimmed a lot. At that point, I was happy with her present and didn’t want her past to interfere with the contentment she was beginning to find.c/p from my goodreads",

        "reviewDescription": "I continue to buy every new Joe Bishop/Skippy novel by Craig Alanson. He’s gotten better at building compelling plots that keep me turning the pages to find out what happens. The element of humor remains. I do a mental chuckle every time Bishop says “rotten kitties.”And I remain unhappy that Alanson uses commas almost at random, often to string together two or three ungrammatical run-on sentences.I’m equally unhappy that Alanson, despite at this point being a bestselling author, also refuses to employ a copy editor. There’s an impossible-to-comprehend sentence error every chapter or two, and an obvious misspelling every third page.To me, part of making a living as a writer is having enough respect for the craft of writing to provide your readers with a high-quality project. Alanson’s bad grammar and refusal to edit his books, to me, is like a contractor who leaves your new kitchen full of badly taped drywall seams, nail pops, miswired lighting, and cabinet doors that close crookedly.I wish he’s do better. And I’ll never start another Alanson series, because the writing’s just as bad when I’ve sampled two of them.",

        "reviewDescription": "There are many five book a year, one trick pony authors desperately pushing out whatever they can as fast as they can, I assume because Amazon's business model prioritises quantity over quality. Craig Alanson has a great universe with lovable characters, but when every chapter of each successive release becomes an increasingly dull rehash of the same conversations again and again, with multiple typos per page and glaring syntax errors, it stops feeling like supporting a grammatically challenged author and starts to feel like deluding myself into a sunk cost fallacy.Alanson is clearly capable of building a world and cooking up an engaging plot, but rather than a carefully, lovingly crafted meal he just throws the ingredients in the microwave, pours the resulting slop, melted Tupperware container and all, onto your plate and sprinkles on a lazy garnish of pop culture. I would love to believe that with popularity comes the resources to give his books more time and care, but the reality is he's over twenty books deep into his career and the quality is still declining.In a morbid attempt to salvage my hopes for this series I visited his websites FAQ to find out if he would ever get an editor. On the contrary,  \"all authors should ignore bad reviews\" and anyone who cares what an editor thinks should see a therapist. You can tell that he's passionate about it, because unlike his books he went a whole paragraph without a spelling error.The first few books in the series had a genuine sense that they were the beginning of something big, but this dead horse of a saga has been truly beaten to the point Craig Alanson could sue Craig Alanson for plaigerism when Expeditionary Force 73: More Monkey Jokes doesn't sell enough copies to satisfy his god complex. Like an abusive relationship I kept hoping for something better, but at some point you have to have to accept that if the author doesn't respect his readers enough to even proof read his own work, why the hell should we pay for the privilege?This book is actually of such low quality you can have it refunded no questions asked because it is legally not fit for purpose. I know, because I just did so. Enjoy!",

Politics, assassins, and Directive 87 threaten to shatter Star Watch just when humanity needs unity most.THE LOST BATTLESHIP is the 24th book in the Lost Starship series, a star-spanning saga of deadly space war by millions-selling author Vaughn Heppner.",

This is sequel to first book which I also found outstanding and was very glad I read.I recommend you get the first book so as not to find yourself in the middle of the story. I recommend you read the first book before reading this one. But, I will give a brief synopsis from the first book to now.  A US soldier returns home from serving overseas living with his parents on a farm.  One day aliens land on earth and attack earth’s industrial and power grid.  Our soldier is able to capture one of the aliens from the invasion.  Invaders are repulse by second set of aliens and earth is so grateful they commit troops to the war being fought.  Troops are deployed to another star system being fought over and our soldier goes thru several ups and down while being deployed.  Toward the end of the book he finds and ancient artifact from highly evolve civilization that ascended.  This artifact turns out to be an AI (artificial Intelligence) with an attitude to insult anything and every one.  This is where the fun begins and thus leads to the second book and very hopeful 3rd book.In this sequel the soldier embarks on a mission to help the AI find ‘THE NETWORK’ or other AI that might still exist.  The AI is hampered with some loss of memory and also absent minded.  In their travels to find the Network they start finding disturbing occurrences in some of solar systems they visit.  Someone or something has been tampering with planets orbits or destroying ancient outpost were the only know people to have this power were the ancients.",

        "reviewDescription": "The titular \"Expeditionary Force\" is no longer the focus of the series, though the next book promises to return to it.  Instead, as was evident in the second half of the first book, this series is about humanity's effort to stay safe from the interstellar war among more advanced species; it is about the quest of the uber-AI Skippy to find something called the Collective; and it is about the relationship between Skippy and Col. Joe and how that plays out in the first two themes.  In truth, it often seems that the second book is more about the third than the first two \"big\" themes, and how the reader reacts to that will largely determine one's relative enjoyment of the book.AT heart it's a buddy story, in which the human is a bit like B.V. Larson's Blake, someone who uses his innate wit to defeat his more capable alien adversaries, and the AI is literally a deus ex machina.  There is a great deal of banter between Joe and Skippy, probably too much, but I chose to see Skippy as Pinocchio-like -- terribly anxious to become a \"real\" person and thus too eager to demonstrate his grasp of the vernacular.  Skippy has all the tools:  every language, vast data and processing power, and a pretty amazing ability to remotely hack others.  What he lacks is, for want of a better word, common sense.The quest puts the crew of the Flying Dutchman into one scrape after another, and the final one is a real doozy.  But their survival and the continuation of their journey is never in doubt -- it's series, for goodness sake -- so one simply needs to enjoy the \"how\" instead of the \"whether\".  This is not a taxing series to read, it is .",

Then other times, out of no where, he punches me with a new emotion I wasn't ready for. There is also so many fun battles, and I do mean fun. These are not normal battles if Joe and Skippy are involved. I can't describe just how exciting these books are. Fun, creative, strange creatures, hilarious, tender, great science, adventure, wonderful and witty dialogue, crazy capers, a Majestic AI named Skippy, a crew that is incredible and adaptable, and many close calls.

        "reviewDescription": "While the author did an okay job of creating a story, characters and dialogue, there was very little action and the story tended to plod along.  One example is that the author puts together a credible team of the most bad ass SpecOps team on (or off) Earth, hence the name of the book, right? He spends considerable time developing that; going into the team's training, talents and personalities.  Are they ever used?  Do they ever fight?Aside from one short low key encounter, no.  The entire namesake of the book has almost nothing to do with the actual story.There were also typos galore, some of them bad enough to make you stop, reread the sentence, figure out what the author was trying to say and read in the correct words.  That becomes a jarring process, taking you out of the story and sometimes making it a pain to read.  The one bright spot in the book was the AI character named Skippy.  His smart ass dialogue was fun and amusing, though at times even that got a little old.  If you are looking for an action packed shoot-em up story, this ISN'T the book for you.",

        "reviewDescription": "Si l'histoire est intéressante, si le ton du récit est toujours amusant, ce second tome souffre des mêmes gros défauts que le premier, l'originalité du propos en moins.L'auteur  privilégie systématiquement les dialogues, les monologues, les résumés. Du coup, sur les 500 pages du livre, on se retrouve avec pas loin de 200 pages de bavardages inutiles, d'exposés techniques ennuyeux, de dialogues répétitifs entre Joe et Skippy et parfois de résumé des chapitres précédents. À force de répétitions, Skippy devient horripilant au fil des pages, par surexploitation de son espièglerie.Les situations sont également très répétitives : à chaque problème insoluble, une solution géniale et innovante est trouvée, souvent par Joe, au grand désarroi de Skippy.Les scènes les plus importantes, les affrontements, les combats, sont le plus souvent escamotées avec un petit résumé, ce qui est assez sidérant dans un livre aussi bavard.Tous les autres personnages du romans sont des ectoplasmes, tant l'auteur est rivé sur la relation Joe / Skippy.SpecsOps aurait pu être un excellent roman de 300 pages. C'est un roman pénible de 500 pages. J'ai envie de connaître la suite de l'histoire, les mystères de cet univers, mais malgré toute la bonne volonté du monde, je ne m'infligerai pas les 3000 pages qui suivent. L'auteur à de l'humour, des idées, mais sa technique narrative est pauvre et son oeuvre manque cruellement du travail d'un éditeur compétent.",

        "reviewDescription": "Books 3 and 4 of the I, Starship series find the RM Sgt Henry Morgan and the crew of the Interchange far from home and moving from pickle.to pickle.Book 3 is a sort of coming of age story for Henry, focusing on him as the ship travels between systems, watching him grapple with his growth and the psychological implications of his existence. His internal journey provides the basis of a strong story and I enjoyed it very much.Book 4 was more of a political thriller, as the ship finds itself caught up in a system's cycle of revolution and counter-revelution. Henry is forced to take an even bigger hand in the action, and the book ends with a sinister cliffhanger that will keep us eagerly awaiting the release of Book 5.Also, as always, kudos to Mark Boyett's narration for providing depth and humanity (even in Henry's case) to Bartlett's story and characters.",

The first humans starship the INTERCHANGE is on its way back to Earth along with a more advanced alien starship to help. The reconstituted mind of dead Marine Henry Morgan is being trusted a little more by Capt Seemey.  Need from Earth is spotty and very dire!",

        "reviewDescription": "I first thought we'd get some breakthrough that these past three books were leading up to a grand reveal about artificial intelligence.  Failure.  I saw the first book as a criticism of open AI, and its ilk.  The second book seemed to imply some benefit of a reconstructed mind over standard human ability, and this book looked as if it were going to address problems associated with an RM going insane.  No. nothing. nada.  We make stupid demands, and brilliantly lucky combat tactics that end up with our getting our way while losing all or friends.  I've got a sour taste in my mouth.",

Due to communications they have received, the ship and crew have to immediately return to Earth. They are helped in this by the race they befriended in the second book.The author has given us quite a few interesting twists. He also continues to build out the main characters including the RM (Reconstituted Mind, formerly Sergeant Henry Morgan). I enjoyed the direction the author took us once the ships arrived back out our solar system. Earth is in dire shape for a few reasons (sorry, no spoilers).This is another very good read by Scott Barlett and I can’t wait for the next book to come out. I gave this 5 stars based on what you read above.",

    "bookDescription": "They call him father, liberator, warlord, Slave King, Reaper. But he feels a boy as he falls toward the war-torn planet, his armor red, his army vast, his heart heavy. It is the tenth year of war and the thirty-third of his life.\nA decade ago Darrow was the hero of the revolution he believed would break the chains of the Society. But the Rising has shattered everything: Instead of peace and freedom, it has brought endless war. Now he must risk all he has fought for on one last desperate mission. Darrow still believes he can save everyone, but can he save himself?\nAnd throughout the worlds, other destinies entwine with Darrow’s to change his fate forever:\nA young Red girl flees tragedy in her refugee camp, and achieves for herself a new life she could never have imagined.\nAn ex-soldier broken by grief is forced to steal the most valuable thing in the galaxy–or pay with his life.\nAnd Lysander au Lune, the heir in exile to the Sovereign, wanders the stars with his mentor, Cassius, haunted by the loss of the world that Darrow transformed, and dreaming of what will rise from its ashes.\nRed Rising was the story of the end of one universe. Iron Gold is the story of the creation of a new one. Witness the beginning of a stunning new saga of tragedy and triumph from masterly New York Times bestselling author Pierce Brown.\nAdapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music!\nPerformed by Stewart Crank, Alex Hill-Knight, Elena Anderson, Christopher Tester, Jenna Sharpe, John Kielty, Todd Scofield, Richard Rohan, Jon Vertullo, Eva Wilhelm, Melody Muze, Jeff Baker, Damon Alums, Lise Bruneau, Danny Gavigan, Rayner Gabriel, Matthew Schleigh, Eric Messner, Michael John Casey, Nathaniel Priestly, Drew Kopas, Carolyn Kashner, Elizabeth Jernigan, Su Ling Chan, Nora Achrati, Jessica Schly, Tia Shearer, Robb Moreira, Marni Penning, Peter Stanley, Robert Bayley, Andy Brownstein, Rana Kay, Christopher Walker, Colleen Delany, Michael Glenn, Nanette Savard, Stephanie Nemeth-Parker, Laura C.

        "reviewDescription": "Wow, Pierce, just wow! Really with that ending…Okay, so into the review.For starters, I still love this series! I understand that this book is the start of the last four. I loved the first three in the series, the character development, and the world, just all of it! fast-forward, we get into book 4 and we have four different POV‘s. Each POV is telling a different view of the lives and you see where they stand on the ladder of society after the fall in book three. One POV being Darrow a gold, Leary, a red, Lysander, another gold, and Ephraim, a gray. I can see how each piece in this book is going to fit together to form the puzzle in the rest of the series, but man, I’m mad about a couple of things, one why Cassius? Cassius had the best redemption arc, and this happens to him? I did really enjoy Leary and Ephraim‘s side and I think they are great characters. Also, I think they are going to have good development and redemption, hopefully… finally I’m gonna leave this review with the ending of garbage. And I don’t mean written bad garbage. It was written really well but it was garbage in the fact that now I have to pick up the next book and find out what happens because Darrow just can’t go off and do that.Ugh…… I am giving this 4 stars because I did enjoy it, but I better have answers…IF YOU READ THIS SERIES, do the dramatic audio!",

    "bookDescription": "Perfect for an entry-level sci-fi listener and the ideal addition to a veteran fan’s collection, John Scalzi's Old Man’s War will take audiences on a heart-stopping adventure into the far corners of the universe.  John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army.  The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce—and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.  Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.  John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine—and what he will become is far stranger.   John Scalzi's Old Man's War is a stunning novel of the long war for human survival—in a universe replete with hostility",

        "reviewTitle": "An Entertaining Read ... But ...",
        "reviewDescription": "This is one of those books that, for me at least, was just shy of something damn near perfect.  First, the good:John Scalzi has a wicked sense of humor; this book starts off with a fantastically trite and sardonic perspective (told through a first person narrative).  Despite this book being billed as a sci-fi adventure book, a large portion of the first third or so of this book is told with a very sarcastic bend, which, frankly, makes some otherwise unsettling or nerve-rattling scenes a little easier to take.  Additionally, a lot of Scalzi's ideas for this story, while inspired heavily by things like \"Starship Troopers\" and other classic sci-fi tales, are rather intriguing and solidly thought out, with just enough originality to avoid simple imitation.  Indeed, at just about the point that the reader starts coming up with a lot of questions about a presented concept, Scalzi has a character start to answer most (though not all) of those questions.  Additionally, Scalzi does a very good job with character dialogue and pacing in this story; he's the kind of author that is obviously good at telling stories in this sense.  And for the most part, the events in this story are handled very well.However, where things tend to break down a bit are the more technical aspects of this story.  There are aliens in this novel, I'll just come out and say that.  But as a concept, the idea of there being aliens was presented to the reader in a rather confusing and somewhat bungled manner ... it's hard to explain without spoilers, or large plot synopsis, but basically, it didn't work well.  But after that, Scalzi just casually throws around that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of known sentient alien races, and proceeds to name at more than a half-dozen of them in this book alone.  And yet really, only 2 of them receive any real attention, with another 2 or 3 being covered in brief encounters.  This seemed a bit overwhelming ... but this is made somewhat worse by the fact that none of these aliens are ever described in any real detail.  The most described alien race is the only one that is mentioned twice, but even then, it's only described in a round-about manner, with no comprehensive \"first-impression\" type of breakdown.  And in the context of the narrative, there's really not a good reason for this failing.  In fact, Scalzi rarely stops to provide extensive physical descriptions in this story, whether it be for new alien species, or for a human character.  Also, I'm just going to say it now: there are sentient one-inch tall aliens in this book ... as physically impossible as I'm certain that is.Further, Scalzi also lacks, many times, in providing full context for some scenes, leaving me confused as to the specifics of certain events.  While taking a lighter angle to narration is often the contemporary style, here Scalzi sometimes seems to skim over things, leaving events relayed more as a news bulletins or after-action reports than actual accountings.  And while the first third or so of this book starts out VERY strong (there is a particularly funny drill sergeant bit about halfway through that shows that Scalzi is great at the long-form joke), the last half or so kind of falls into a standard military shoot 'em up format.  Towards this later portion, there are tantalizing bits hinting at certain ethical or emotional dilemmas that could have been developed into something enlightening, but that just kind of get lost after the narrative moves to the next battle.  And that's a large portion of why I give this book 4 stars ... Scalzi seems to have gotten SO CLOSE to something border-line genius in scope and philosophy, but then passes it by.Overall, despite the short-comings and the criticisms I had, I loved the book, which ends on a rather bitter-sweet note, and look forward to reading the next in the series.",

        "reviewTitle": "My new favorite book in the military sci-fi genre",
        "reviewDescription": "Military science fiction is one of the most popular and beloved subgenres in fiction. Titles like War of the Worlds and Starship Troopers continue to captivate readers to this day. Hollywood took notice, gifting us mega-hits like Aliens and Battlestar Galactica. The genre is jam-packed with weighted themes, pulsing action, and mind-bending tech that often provides new and interesting ways of thinking about the universe we inhabit.Starship Troopers has been a personal favorite for years, written by the legendary Robert A. Heinlein. It courts controversial topics with an eerie effectiveness, a testament to Heinlein’s enduring brilliance. His understanding of the military machine oozes from the page and sucks you into his character motivations. I thought for sure that this book would endure as my go-to measuring stick for the genre.That is, until I read Old Man’s War.John Scalzi is a New York Times bestselling author with a Hugo Award under his belt. Dude has some serious cred, so I went into the book with lofty expectations. Old Man’s War is the first of a six-book series that I plan to gleefully devour. The first book was in my to-read pile for quite some time, as the recommendation kept rearing its head in conversation. Once it reached the top, I actually felt a wash of relief. “Finally, I can see what all the fuss is about.” Several hours later, I put the book down and simply uttered, “Holy ****.”Without giving anything away, as a happy husband in a two-decade relationship that is still going strong, this book hit me hard in the feels.I was not expecting that from a military sci-fi novel, albeit one with an enthralling narrative voice. The “old man” part refers to an advanced version of Earth where retirees are the ones who join the Armed Forces. The idea is that a wealth of experience is far more valuable than youthful vigor. And when you live in a world where the military can provide you with a brand new combat-ready body (complete with green skin), it makes a hell of a lot of sense.The story follows John Perry, a 75-year-old senior who lost his wife and is reaching the end of his days. He joins the military, because why not. He is promised a new and exciting life beyond the stars, fighting for ... well, something. It doesn’t matter. He’s moving forward, and that’s all that matters. John makes new friends along the way and discovers that he is quite adept at his new life battling aliens from planet to planet.Old Man’s War takes several dives into familiar themes, first and foremost, what it means to be human. Others include the role of advanced technology and the psychological stresses of war. But what Scalzi manages to do is frame them inside a new landscape (or hellscape more like it), one that paints foes as unbeatable and treats characters like members of a hive colony. In many ways, it’s a complete role reversal of books like Starship Troopers, which gives the reader a fascinating new perspective on personal relations and interstellar conflicts.The book is engrossing up to the third act, at which point it rises to the rank of classic. It pains me to stay mum about it, but it would pain me more to spoil it for anyone else. Old Man’s War is not only my new favorite book in the genre, it’s also a new favorite all around.The saga continues with The Ghost Brigades, which is exactly where I’ll be shortly after posting this review (with apologies to my to-read pile).",

        "reviewDescription": "I was searching the Sci-Fi bestsellers list here on Amazon a few months ago and came across this book: Old Man's War. It was listed as a first novel by a new author so I read a little further, liked the premise and bought it and its sequels: The Ghost Brigades and The Last Colony. Shortly thereafter I received all three and after finishing the book I was reading I launched into this one. Shortly thereafter, I finished The Last Colony having quickly read all three.Amazing, page-turners, engaging, entertaining, humorous, gut-wrenching, I could go on. All the books (including the 4th, and best, Zoe's Tale) are awesome pieces of writing. Simply put, if you have any interest in science fiction and any of the write-ups for the books in this series intrigue you, buy all 4 as you will not be disappointed. As for Mr. Scalzi, keep 'em coming in this \"universe;\" I know you probably have one or two more in you!",

    "bookDescription": "After a decade, acclaimed science fiction master John Scalzi returns to the galaxy of the Old Man's War series with the long awaited seventh book, The Shattering Peace  THE PEACE IS SHATTERING  For a decade, peace has reigned in interstellar space. A tripartite agreement between the Colonial Union, the Earth, and the alien Conclave has kept the forces of war at bay, even when some would have preferred to return to the fighting and struggle of former times. For now, more sensible heads have prevailed – and have even championed unity.  But now, there is a new force that threatens the hard-maintained peace: The Consu, the most advanced intelligent species humans have ever met, are on the cusp of a species-defining civil war. This war is between Consu factions... but nothing the Consu ever do is just about them. The Colonial Union, the Earth and the Conclave have been unwillingly dragged into the conflict, in the most surprising of ways.  Gretchen Trujillo is a mid-level diplomat, working in an unimportant part of the Colonial Union bureaucracy. But when she is called to take part in a secret mission involving representatives from every powerful faction in space, what she finds there has the chance to redefine the destinies of humans and aliens alike... or destroy them forever.",

I would strongly recommend that you read the first six books before Shattering Peace.Gretchen, the protagonist of Shattering Peace, tells us that she was Zoe Perry's best friend. I remember John Perry (the original protagonist), his wife Jane Sagan, and their adopted daughter Zoe. I don't recall Gretchen but that's fine. (Gretchen knows her stuff so it doesn't matter how well she knew Zoe.)John Perry was a soldier. Gretchen is a diplomat. We are now at a point where keeping the peace is critical. No one wants war to break out again.Gretchen is summoned to deal with a diplomatic crisis. For this she gets an Obin assistant, Ran.  I particularly enjoyed the Obin Ran. I enjoy well-drawn alien races.The Consu are back, and the first one Gretchen meets is suicidal. The story goes on from there.I found Shattering Peace an immensely enjoyable read. The writing is both smart and snarky. Classic Scalzi. And why I love this series.",

Keep thinks it's a run of bad luck. Ben isn't so sure.\nBefore long, Ben's chasing saboteurs who shouldn't exist, investigating crimes that make no sense, and trying to stop a war between the Empire and the Outer Rim. Oh, and Emerald keeps insisting they're married.\nThe clock is ticking as Ben and his crew race to figure out who's responsible for the madness before businesses collapse, people die, and Emerald actually makes Ben go to couple's therapy. But when every lead points in a different direction and even his allies can't be trusted, Ben's going to learn that the deck has been stacked from the beginning.\nGood thing he's always been a wild card.",

        "reviewDescription": "I love this series, it became a surprised favorite when 1/2 way through book 1 the book went from merely a decent military sci-fi space opera to LOL wild and funny ride with the introduction of Skippy. Book 5 did not disappoint and it was good really good fun, I do look forward to book 6 but I will say that some of the jokes and plot lines are starting to get a bit ridiculous. Also, Skippy's relationship with Joe and the rest of the the not-so-merry-band-of-pirates needs to develop further. It just seems like the relationship has plateau in book 2 and every book since has just been \"more of the same\". I get that Skippy was originally used as a comic relief + force multiplier but he is very much a major character in the series now and should be treated as such. Ex. Book 5 feels kind of like book 2... with higher stakes...I hope Book 6 will seriously move both the character development and the plot line forward in a significant way. I see plenty of runway left in the series given the rich universe that Craig has created. But as it stands, the over reliance of Skippy being awesome but absentminded is seriously hindering both character and plot development.So what if other \"older\" races gets more involve in the future story line? At the end of the day, the story will more or less be the same one that's been told in book 2-5. Humanity is screw -> Monkeys can't do anything -> Joe / other monkey came up with some non-conventional solution that absentminded Skippy can't figured out -> problem is solved because Skippy did something awesome that other race can't even begin to understand -> monkey wins! But... unintended consequences... repeat.Again, it was great, but 5.5 books in I think the series needs to make some changes, take some risk to move the plot and the character development forward.",

I just couldn’t wait this time for the audio version (even though R.C Bray does an amazing job and I will listen when it’s available) - that’s how good they are.This is basically a series I would be happy to contain twenty books - and I’d still be disappointed when it ended.This book centres even more closely on the relationship between the human Joe Bishop and the AI Skippy (the Magnificent). They are on more equal terms this time due to circumstances and for the first time it’s made clear that both benefit from their relationship (not just Joe and the rest of humanity)- the true awesomness happens when BOTH work together.Their relationship has helped this series be more than a “battle aliens to save earth” formulaic - it brings laughs, head shaking and even the occasional tear (although if you tell anyone I’ll deny it). There’s also a few space battles, near misses, alien encounters and “hold my beer” moments of  course. I understand there are 12 books planned overall so don’t expect huge plot progression in each book - this is a 12 course fine dining experience - not fast food. Plenty happened to keep me entertained from the first page to the last.Listen to the audio if you can (and I recommend 1.25 speed) but if you can’t at lead READ this awesome series.",

        "reviewDescription": "I've been reading all of the Expeditionary Force books and the series is terrific.  Yes, it's science fiction but the stories take place only a few years into the future so the technological skills of the human race are not too different from what they are now.  I don't want to say too much about the plot because it could spoil it.  But, I will add that series involves interactions between humans and more advanced alien species.  The characters are well developed and very believable.  Even the alien technology seems believable.  The story line keeps the reader riveted even when the discussions are obviously intended to educate the reader.Also, I must add that I've been listening to the audio versions in addition to reading the books.  They are read by R C Bray, and he adds so much.  The next audio version in the series won't be out until this fall.  I may skip reading the next one and just go for the audio version.",

I know this is science fiction but fthe author could research the well known things like diving physics and why you would not be crushed on the depth of 400 feet or how stars works and what make them live longer. In my opinion because you write s-f novel does not make it all right to write such things as was written in this book (I need to be vague and soft because Amazon doesn't allow me to express what I really think of this part of the book). Could be 3-4 stars but well because of this is only 1.",

The orks in this book feel like something you should be truly terrified that lurks in the darkness.All the characters are great in this book as well. I was interested in see what happened to all of them form the space Marines to the humans.If you are interested in see how the orks can be something to fear or in the Crimson fist’s fight to stay alive you will not be disappointed.",

        "reviewDescription": "\"Rynn's World\" hatte eigentlich von Anfang ein einen schweren Stand bei mir. Zwar bin ich ausgemachter Space Marine-Fanboy, aber grade die Crimson Fists waren für mich nie ein Orden, der besonders viel Aufmerksamkeit genoss - auch deswegen, weil ich sie für Imperial Fists Light gehalten habe, die einfach nur ein Abklatsch ihrer \"größeren\" Brüder sind.Von daher hat Steve Parker schon Vieles richtig gemacht, indem er es geschafft hat, mich doch für den Roman zu begeistern. Das liegt vor Allem daran, dass er sich Zeit lässt, um die Schlacht um die Heimatwelt des Ordens vorzubereiten. Es geht nicht direkt los, sondern man wird recht \"sanft\" eingeführt, lernt die wichtigsten Protagonisten kennen, sieht die Welt durch die Augen verschiedener Charaktere (Astartes und Nicht-Astartes) und wird auch auf die Schlachtfelder geführt, die abseits von Rynn's World liegen.Dann geht's auf einmal aber ziemlich schnell, als Snagrod der Ärzbrandstifta den Planeten belagert, eine gewaltige Raumschlacht entbrennt und in einer darauf folgenden Katastrophe (Unfall oder Sabotage?) die Ordensfestung des Ordens völlig zerstört und die Verteidiger somit direkt um einen Großteil ihrer Stärke beraubt werden. Der große Rest des Buches dreht sich dann einerseits um den Marsch der Überlebenden in den Südwesten, nach New Rynn, die Hauptstadt des Planeten, wo sich andererseits der Rest der Astartes zur letzten Verteidigung stellen und wo sie so lange aufhalten wollen, bis die wenigen Schiffe, die der Belagerung durch die Orks entkommen konnten, mit Verstärkung zurück sind.Parker legt hier den Fokus aber weniger auf die detaillierte Ausarbeitung der einzelnen Schlachten und Scharmützel, sondern eher darauf, zu beschreiben, wie sich die wenigen Hauptcharaktere, insbesondere Ordensmeister Pedro Kantor und der Captain der 4ten Kompanie, Alessio Cortez, fühlen, während sie einerseits mit der Beinahe-Vernichtung ihres Ordens zurecht kommen müssen und andererseits danach dürsten, endlich das Blut der Xenos zu vergießen.Das liest sich alles ziemlich flüssig und kurzweilig und recht schnell blättert man sich durch den weit über 500 Seiten starken Roman (nicht wie im Artikel-Text stehend 416 Seiten...), aber der gute Lesefluss und die kurzweilige Darstellung der Ereignisse geht leider zulasten des Tiefgangs, sprich: man blickt zwar in die Köpfe der Astartes und einiger Menschen, aber so richtig wird man dabei trotzdem nicht warm mit ihnen und man hat ständig das Gefühl, als müsste hier noch mehr kommen.Ähnlich war das Empfinden auch bei \"Reiksguard\", dem ersten Roman der \"Imperiums\"-Reihe bei Warhammer Fantasy, sprich: ein gut lesbarer Roman für zwischendurch, ein guter Start einer neuen Reihe - aber bei weitem noch nicht deren Höhepunkt und ganz sicher noch ausbaubar.",

Just to realize how ineffective we'd really be to such advanced aliens. To me, it's a more believable story of how we would be if such a thing would happen. Our real lack of understanding of technologies that would have been created by other races to cross galaxies. What ends up happening is a chance discovery of a wise cracking alien AI that strikes a bargain with an army officer. The story takes off from there as the alien AI is the only thing that gives humanity a fighting chance.The only draw back I have, is not the story. It's the way the author will explain a \"thing or scenario\" in the story. A \"fact\" will be stated, then that fact will be restated in the characters point of view, or a different combination of ways, and at times, again in a different way. It's tiresome and in most cases an unnecessary retelling of what was said, happened, happening or stated in a prior sentence, making a paragraph/chapter longer than it should be.All that being said, I'm looking forward to the next book.",

        "reviewTitle": "How to start a civil war among lizards",
        "reviewDescription": "The \"Expeditionary Force\" series is at turns amusing, puzzling, and irritating.  It purports to follow the exploits of a stolen spaceship commanded by  Joe Bishop assisted by possibly the most intelligent being in the universe, an Elder AI in the shape of a beer can, playfully named \"Skippy\", which is all that stands between Earth and more advanced alien races that would exterminate humanity (for reasons that are not entirely clear).  Their complicated exploits invariably involve Skippy using his vast powers to cheat the technical systems of whatever the target might be, while not revealing the intervention of humans in any way; and in the end, Bishop must come up with fixes since Skippy is not perfect and  in fact is in his own fight with a worm.There are plenty of serious moments, but the series is sprinkled with banter between Bishop and Skippy that is fun but not what one expects from a hyper-intelligent AI and often seems to simply be banal filler.  And the overall mission to keep Earth safe is somewhat lost in the puzzle-solving required by each adventure.  This series is filling a peculiar niche in the sci-fi universe, half-way between serious and light-hearted.Book 4 requires the Merry Band of Pirates to foment a broad civil war among the lizards, and it is a typically good read.",

        "reviewDescription": "Really enjoying the world Craig Alanson has created. Col Joe Bishop is a likable protagonist, and Skippy engages but doesn’t overwhelm with its many abilities. The big challenge (I think) with this kind of story is that of rehashing the original plot complication ad nauseum, and rescuing the characters over and over again with some godlike super power. Somehow the writer has avoided that trap and succeeds with a very cool story!",

        "reviewDescription": "The good news first. This author is a very good story teller-- to a point. I have read all the books in the series and have enjoyed every one. The bad news is this author does not know how to finish a story. Either he is unsure of his ability as a good writer or he is unsure of the reader’s ability to perceive this and is afraid they won't come back.  How else would one account for the annoying fourth-grader technique of finishing stories with “cliffhangers”? At best it is disrespectful of his readers; at worst it suggests a perverse enjoyment of inflicting punishment on his readers for being so daring as to finish reading one of his books. Good story telling includes giving your reader closure with perhaps a hint of more to come. This book has no closure;  the author just stops writing at a pivotal moment and inserts “The End”. “oh? You were expecting more? Maybe next time. Ha ha.” Anyway, I felt cheated as I realized the story was not going to give me closure.My advice is to wait until he is done with the series before buying in; save yourself some unwelcome frustration.",

        "reviewDescription": "Paradise, the third book in the Expeditionary Force series, is every bit as enjoyable as the first two. The banter between Col./Sgt Joe and Skippy is witty and endlessly entertaining. I envy Craig Alanson's inventiveness in being able to craft these stories, although I think that his greatest inspiration was to introduce Skippy in 'Columbus Day' as a 'deus ex machina' device. That's when the whole tone of the narrative changed (for the better). Since then, Skippy's prime purpose has been to fulfill that role, but in a most enjoyable way. And there's much more to come. According to Mr. Alanson, he has planned for the series to consist of 12 books, and has even written the last two chapters of the twelfth and final book so that he knows where he's going with the overall narrative. At least that's what he says - speaking as a sometime writer myself, I know trying to nail it down so far ahead can be overly ambitious. Characters tend to take on a life of their own and may refuse to toe the line when it comes to being shoe-horned into those final two chapters. I would like to give 'Paradise' five stars but sadly need to deduct one because of the ongoing lack of good proof-reading that has dogged all three books so far.",

If you did like the first two, then you'll like this one.  Probably a bit more actually, as it's pretty similar but the writing has improved.  Same fun characters (plus some new one's), same creative use of science, and answers to some plot threads that have been dangling unanswered since the first book.  It's a very enjoyable read, and is one of the few military sci-fi novels that actually gets military culture and humor.",

        "reviewDescription": "This was definitely the best “ Earth meets aliens genre” that I’ve ever read. The entire series is full of action, great characters and actual comedy that makes you laugh out loud. I’ve been bouncing between the audible book and the written story. The narration is so good, when I read the book, Skippy‘s voice is in my head. My brother recommended this series to me and is actually rereading it right now. That’s the better review, with all the content out there, to want to read a book series twice means it better be really well written.",

        "reviewTitle": "if you're out there in space trying to save the world from 4 different alien species with superior firepower and intellect",
        "reviewDescription": "If you haven't read books 1 (Columbus Day) and 2 (SpecOps), you should read them first to get the proper background leading up to Paradise. The book is well written, but....  The main character is an Army Corporal who goes off to fight on another planet and discovers things aren't as they seem. He is promoted to Sargeant, although he doesn't feel he's ready. Events progress and he finds himself suddenly promoted (by the alien patrons for whom he is fighting) to full Colonel. Yep, E-5 buck Sgt all the way to O-6 bird Colonel. So now he's moved from nominally-qualified Sgt to totally-out-of-his-depth Col. He constantly second-guesses his decisions, and is in the uncomfortable position of commanding the people who he saluted just the day before. But that's just the beginning of his troubles: he finds an acid-tongued, disdainful, insulting Artificial Intelligence in a beer can sized metal capsule who considers humans to be lower than the monkeys he constantly compares them to. Not only is Skippy (the name our hero chose to call the AI) a couple of million years old, he has all the digital data ever recorded in all the data banks in the whole universe in his memory banks, he speaks every language in the universe, and can hold separate conversations with every human on earth simultaneously, while playing chess at the same time. So, if you're out there in space trying to save the world from 4 different alien species with superior firepower and intellect, it's dang convenient to have such a superior problem-solver on your side. I grew very tired of the constant insults, arrogant comments, and constant embarrassments visited upon the human crew (especially on the hero of the story) by the A-I, and found his omnipotence to be unbelievable and intensely irritating. However, the final straw for me is the ending of the story. One of the important things I learned from my 20+ years of military service: like the US Marines and other services SpecOps believe - You do not leave any of your people behind. Everyone goes home....",

I would still love to see a little less meaningless banter between the crew and Skippy though. Sometimes, it goes on for many pages when it would be just as funny and get the point across with only one or two pages. I tend to skip all of those pages to get to a better part, but I understand they serve a purpose for compensation to the author and put up with it. Anyway, I would HIGHLY recommend not only this book but the entire series.",

        "reviewDescription": "I would probably go 3.5 stars on this one if I could..The lives of elder AI Skippy, General Joe Bishop and the band of\"Merry Pirates\" are never easy.  Despite having brought to Earth atame Elder Sentinel at the end of the previous book, Earth's havingan apparent (because of course being the Merry Pirates, it's all abluff) protector only leads to *new* problems with the Awful Kittiesand Lazy Spiders and both of their multi-species coalitions, notto mention the Jeraptha dirty-tricks division pinning some of theirown over-the-top exploits on Bishop.As usual, Bishop can't even tell his chain of command the true situationas all communications on Earth are hopelessly compromised by the seniorspecies, and the final icing on this unappetizing cake is the fact thatapparently there has been a second Elder AI acting against Joe & Skippythe whole time, a player they absolutely have to flush out to have anychance of winning.I think there must have been an episode left out of the last book theway the Kristang return to Earth was relegated to an audio-drama inbetween two other books.  In the event, we never do learn how the Piratesfound the Sentinel and how Skippy brought it on-side.  That's not exactlya minor point!  On the whole I thought this book was a bit below theseries average.  The humor was more forced than usual, and while I neverfigured out Bishop's plan in toto, I knew certain events we were seeingwere parts of it as had been telegraphed a bit too clearly.  Still thedenouement signals that we are finally heading towards the endgame, andI'm still on board.",

        "reviewDescription": "Thanks god it was the last book of this series. The series started as a something fresh with cheeky dialogues. However, in my opinion the series is too long. In some books hardly anything happens and are boring to some extent. There are phrases repeated by the author quite a few times along the books. On the other hand, in last book many things happen without previous notice and they must be explained in a rush at the end.Overall, I found the series entertaining when only considering the action and the adventures.When I think beyond that point, I can only worry about political prejudices and xenophobic behaviour. Joe Bishop becomes de facto a dictator, taking decisions afecting all humanity but without allowing people to vote or at least to voice an opinion. Bishop knows best. Also Bishop has no remorse starting actions that cause death of millions or billions of alien sentient beings; all seem to be right because there not people but the enemy.",

        "reviewDescription": "If you've started reading the captive series, this novella sets the stage for all the things gently implied in the first book, and pulls the curtain aside just a little bit as to where the author seems to intend to go. I had originally thought they were going to do a \"Hogan's heroes\", classic take on the captive hero dominating his captors - and I think it may still go there - but here is a peek at the \"other side\" of the great war that is only alluded to in the first book. I really enjoyed the little twist, though it was predictable, it was still well presented and the story told is well written and integrated. It has a haldeman-esque \"forever war\" theme that is not unwelcome (or all that unexpected, considering the ties to realism that Corey generally works into their work), and the live suits themselves (and things like it) aren't unheard of in science fiction (there are literally thousands of books with similar themes), so don't come in expecting something wildly innovative; but the story is what engages and keeps you reading.It's a novella and the intention is just world building, and I'm happy with it as that - a whole book dedicated to the lives of these soldiers would be less interesting (and it's been done before a million times, see forever war, armor, or any number of works by some very talented writers), but this novella works to help flesh out what I don't doubt will be an interesting introduction of the \"mysterious\" opponents of the carryx. I'm air quoting mysterious because... Well, kinda predictable. But I'm hoping there will be some surprises. I'm still looking forward to it though, because the story-telling is just so good.TLDR; If you're a fan of the author(s) this book won't disappoint. If you're just looking for a burst of sci-fi techno thriller action, it'll scratch the itch. Worth reading.",

The setting is fleshed out just enough to bring the reader along and sympathize with the characters as they try to sus out their surroundings.  This short story helps to answer some, but generate even more questions about this new series from a completely different perspective that had me engaged from word one, and has me desperate for more.  Most importantly, for me, I felt respected as an audience.  The Livesuit felt real, with an ending that was shocking and has the potential for much larger implications to the larger story to come!",

        "reviewDescription": "I haven't read the actual book that this one came from yet, but as a standalone story there is a lot going on here. A great interesting not necessarily very far future sci-fi book.Trying to figure out what is current and what is past can be a bit confusing throughout the book, but overall it's very interesting. It describes a possible future military and how we could possibly get to the point where we can fight off an alien invasion.",

Easy to read and just ninety pages total. Only spotted two mistakes: «Another solar system had just been killed.» There’s only one solar system, the one we live in. Others are typically called planetary systems or star systems, or named after their star, like the Oberon system, or the Pegasus system. And «light years» should be written «light-years». We’re not talking heavy or light years, right?The ending did not surprise me, and this idea is far from new, but I liked the book.",

Corey's (Franck and Abraham alike) style is something I am personally fond of, and they do well with rounded arcs--something I appreciate in the age of franchise. Every bit, prologue and epilogue and novella alike, adds something to the main story, fleshing out a universe that is thoughtfully constructed.This story in particular was exceptional for the cohesion of structure and plot: a nonlinear story getting told in a nonlinear fashion that keeps it comprehensible. A few points I thought I was misremembering details only to discover the real plot with the protagonist. I cannot recommend this enough if you have read Mercy of Gods. Also if you have not.",

They've been in a universe spanning war for generations, and we're introduced to one human who decides to be part of the forces fighting the enemy. This novella lays background for a key element in The Mercy of Gods - we'll see where this takes us!Again, the audiobook really needs scene cues or pauses for changes in time or speaker.

Unless you make it fun.Tasked with a simple prisoner transfer, Icky convinces Funboy to take a chance on something that goes against every fiber of his being.The Galaxy's Biggest Buffet.Naturally, things don't go well. There are sneeze guards, and cheese fountains, and a small case of murder that lands Icky and Funboy as suspects in a crime so heinous, it almost interrupted their breakfast.Come along as Funboy unleashes his unparalleled desire for truth, good hygiene, and justice while Icky—Icky is going to smash things and eat, sometimes at once. Because that's what friends do. They pursue their passions, they lift each other up, and they look for ways to beat a murder rap, hopefully in time for dinner.",

It was his chance for redemption.\nUntil everything went wrong.\nThe cave should have been deserted. The perfect place to hide. Instead, it’s crawling with soldiers and engineers working to unearth the impossible:\nExcalibur.\nDeep beneath the mountain, she’s waited centuries to be found. Not a sword in the stone, but a starship. And according to the onboard AI, Thomas is the only one who can command her.\nNow he's on the run across a galaxy more astonishing and treacherous than he ever imagined, where magic and technology intertwine and ancient powers lurk in the shadows. Relentlessly hunted and hopelessly lost, he needs to learn fast if he wants to survive. Only his greatest challenge isn't training to pilot a starship. It's accepting that he, of all people, is responsible for reigniting the hope of a fallen kingdom.\nKing Arthur’s legend may be complete, but his is just beginning…",

There are moments in the story that the author describes certain things more than once, but the writing doesn't lack because of it.The characters are nice and have interesting personalities. The concepts and entry level knowledge of science isn't intense and I believe that this book is particularly suited for young readers. But be warned there are some intense violent battles with magic weapons and swords however not necessarily too graphic. I'd recommend reading it a little yourself before deciding on whether this book is right for your kids if you're worried about that.:)The plotline can be a little predictable at times and at other times might throw a few twists your way. The grammar flows well and you find yourself often rooting for the protagonist.In summary I recommend this book if your looking for a new series to fill in time between other series or if you have a particular wish to read this series.",

I hope when I get my book published it will give others the joy your book has given me. I have enjoyed Syfy for many years now and at 70 I find that in so many ways it has a way of imitating real life. It can explain old mysteries in new ways that are not only entertaining but also therapeutic and even healing. Life is an amazing thing filled with so many unexplained things and Syfy stories are able to help give us a small view of a universe of possibilities if we keep an open mind to them. Thank you again for your story. I can't wait to read the next chapter in Thomas's adventure.",

        "reviewDescription": "I was a bit hesitant to start into this book, having read many reviewers stating how much different this book is from Ender's Game.  It's true, Speaker is its own beast; a distinctly different tone, setting, pace and plot, but it has the same basic premise and spirit. The significant difference, in my mind, is the level of maturity. Whereas Ender's Game was fast paced, and written in a manner that anyone of practically any age can enjoy, Speaker is geared more towards a mature reader, and is written with greater emotional and philosophical depth.On its own, Speaker could have been a great novel, but I think Card's decision to write Ender as a full novel gives Speaker even more depth and meaning. If the only thing you really enjoyed from Ender was the battles, then there's not much need to read this book - give yourself a few years, reread Ender, and give yourself a chance to appreciate the human interactions of Ender, because to me that was the greatest strength of Ender as well as Speaker. Once you fully appreciate Ender, there's no way you won't appreciate and love this novel as well.Speaker is a great story, with fantastic characters that jumped off the page for me, and it was highly satisfying to see Ender as a man. However, I did feel that the novel gave short shrift to its early characters and that some of the philosophy that is delved into in the next book, Xenocide, could have been brought forward and fleshed out here. I think that perhaps an additional 50-100 pages would have been sufficient to bring more life and meaning to the characters before Ender arrives.Despite this, Speaker is one of the best novels that I've ever read. It is masterfully written, and conceived. I'm sure that even though this book does give a feeling of completion in term of plot resolution at the end, you will want more, and the next two novels in the series will be a necessary read for everyone.",

        "reviewDescription": "This review is for the Kindle edition ebook.This is the follow up to \"Ender's Game\". It is the story of how Ender Wiggin learned to cooperate with alien life, rather than destroy it. In the first book, Ender learns to play a computer game that eventually wipes out an entire alien race. In this book, Ender must deal with the guilt and pain of causing that race to disappear. He also has learned not to make that mistake again.I really got into this story. I do believe we will encounter alien life before the world ends. How we deal with that encounter is always a question. This book is a fictional account of one way to deal with that alien life encounter. I felt the Introduction was too long for this book. I am not one who wants all the background behind the story at the front of the book. I would rather the author explain this at at the end. I want to read the story, then will read the explanations.I find the idea of someone speaking about the dead in a manner that correctly emphasizes their life and goals as very inspiring. I have been to more funerals than I care to count, and most of the time, the dead are spoken of as almost perfect. They were not that way in life, and yet, we, the survivors, find it very difficult to express their lives in real terms. I do not intend any disrespect to the dead, but it would certainly be refreshing to have a speaker that could put their life into perspective sometimes.I would like to say \"Thank you, Orson Scott Card\", for actually being able to express these thoughts I have had for so many years. Your book should be an inspiration to the living world wide. We should never jump to conclusions about the unknown, nor should we revere the dead above their actual life.I find this book much more reality based than the first book, \"Ender's Game\". For me, it is much better, and I will definitely be reading more of this author's books. While Game is fast-paced and exciting, this book is more involved. It is not a computer simulator game story, instead, it is the story of someone's life and their struggles. While it is fiction, it is an excellent view into the future of mankind. I highly recommend this book to those readers of science fiction who allow themselves to believe in the possibility of alien life.",

        "reviewDescription": "This book got me from the instant I saw the title.  I felt compelled to read it, at least sample it.  I have not read Ender’s Game nor seen the movie.  Even though this is part of the Ender Quintet, Speaker stands on its own.  Storywise, it does come after Ender’s Game because Ender is all grown up now, but I did not feel I was missing any background and was able to piece together the history as I read the book .Speaker for the Dead is an amazing book; I could not put it down.  The author is philosophical, but in a way that makes you understand more about yourself and things around you.  I cried tears of grief and tears of great amazement in reading this book.Truth, lies, good and evil, life, death and rebirth; all defined from a slightly different point of view.The author’s introduction, explaining a bit about his thought process and how he wrote the book led me to believe there was going to be something very gory and evil in the way life is sustained on Lusitania.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The whole life cycle of the piggies turned out to be VERY different from anything we know on Earth, but so awesomely beautiful, I felt as if I could easily live in harmony with them on Lusitania.Anthropological research protocols definitely come into question in this book.  The author challenges you – what would you do in this situation?  Would you insist that these beautiful but very different beings be brought to human standards?  Would that be right?  What if YOU were that Xenador (researcher) would you do the same and try to benefit the beings you were studying or would you try cold-heartedly to stick to protocol?  I cannot even explain the depth of this author’s understanding of the human mind, fixed ideas, religion, politics, the rise and fall of civilizations; and space travel of course.If Enders Game made a good movie, Speaker for the Dead would be totally epic.This book has a fairy tale ending.  In the end, I have only one question – can we trust the hive queen?",

Beats its prequel hands down!While Ender's Game was pretty good, this book is far more diverse, and explores a whole lot of new ideas. Card just enthralls us with this universe of his. The way he slowly builds up the piggies' world and pulls you in.. just brilliant.Characterization is top-notch. Ender is shown to be a much more complex guy, than the child prodigy as shown in #1. And the new characters are pretty awesome as well.. Jane, Miro, Human, Libo.. Everyone has a pretty vital part in the storyline.<Spoiler>The signing of the covenant between the humans and the piggies was the best part of the book. Really mind-blowing stuff, with powerful dialogues.</Spoiler>A definite must-read for SF lovers.",

        "reviewDescription": "I really enjoyed Ender's Game, but Speaker for the Dead was even better.While Ender's Game was written as background for Speaker for the Dead, I think that the books should be read in the order they were published which also makes it chronologically correct: First Ender's Game, then Speaker for the Dead (Ender in Exile is chronologically in between, but I haven't read it yet and it was published years later) In Ender's Game the story evolves around very intelligent children, which makes it interesting for both young and old. Speaker for the Dead seems more mature to me. (Be aware) I'm not sure if the book would be comprehendable and interesting enough for younger kids.The books combine an interesting sci-fi story with intelligence and unusual characters. Personally I enjoy following Ender's thoughts the most. Card describes the characters' reasoning in great detail, which is the interesting part to me while not describing every detail of every landscape or room as so many other fantasy authors do. I really appreciate that since it keeps the story going forward all the time.Even though I have to agree it is not an adventure story in the normal sense, I think in the way it discusses humanity, the impact of truth it never feels boring or too long. There is not a lot of fighting going on, rather an understanding and questions about the way humans treat other species. All in all it is a very intellectual book about how we should also treat each other in understanding our differences.I'm currently reading the third book \"Xenocide\", and would already recommend reading the whole series.",

        "reviewDescription": "\"The Scattering Stars\", book 5 in the space opera series \"I, Starship\" by Scott Bartlett took me by surprise. The series so far is fast paced, full of battles, deceit, edge of your seat writing. I expected book 5 to continue on the same way. My reviews are usually long (check out the previous ones!). So, in order to not write about spoilers, I'll do a quick summary. Something changed, the tone was different. Yes, the characters were the same, and Scott Bartlett definitely followed his previous books. But I experienced an emotion I never had before. I cried. Anything beyond this description I think of being a spoiler. But this book, I feel, is the best so far in this series. Don't take my word for it. We all interpret books we read differently. Read it for yourself and I guarantee you will be waiting for book 6. It's just that good.",

For those of you who don't know, this is book 5 in Scott Bartlett's \"I, Starship\" series, which is a different kind of space opera.  The series overall explore themes like artificial intelligence, slavery, and societal changes over time (which is brilliantly shown to the readers as they travel at relativistic speeds into the future of humanity with the crew of one interstellar ship).  For those of you familiar with the series, you WILL NOT believe the revelations that come out in this installment!  I honestly couldn't put it down and finished it in about 5 hours, but I know I'll be going back to read the entire series again!",

        "reviewDescription": "I first read the ender series as a teenager. Enders Game hooked me in and became one of my favorite stories, however the other books didn't connect with me as well then. Going back and reading the entire series again as an adult, it all works together better as a cohesive and appealing story. The story arc from children fighting a \"necessary\" war, to one man's personal battle to redeem himself for the atrocities he unwittingly committed is played out across millenia. It is given many secondary perspectives and characters you care about. Card's writing matures subtly with the series as well, though on occasion in some of the later books seems to wander. Overall I highly recommend reading this series. If you only read the first book as a teen, it is worth revisiting the set if you are a fan of this genre. If you are a parent looking for a book your teen or preteen will enjoy, the individual novel of Ender's Game is the best starting point.",

        "reviewTitle": "Classic and brilliant",
        "reviewDescription": "I will first answer the question I most needed help with when I first bought this book: is it worth it to buy the whole collection, or will I only want to read Ender's game? Answer: DEFINITELY buy all five books! These are classics, and I don't mean only in their genre. I am confident they would appeal to people of all ages and fans of any type of fiction. Yes, they are science fiction, but they are so much more than that. They are books that speak about - and somehow transcend the topic of - the deepest meaning of humanity. Period. Looking back, I think Orson Scott Card is a genious. I have no doubt he will be remembered as \"one of the great ones\", especially in his own genre.I will try to describe each book to you and give my honest review.Ender's Game: 4.5 stars - For the record, I saw the movie before I read the book. I meant to do it the other way around, but it wasn't possible. So the surprise, edge-of-my-seat element was obviously missing in the book for me, even though it wasn't the writer's fault. I think that is why this is not rated 5 stars, it got a bit slow, since I knew what happened in the end. Still, it was well worth the read. The book is about a world that was changed by an alien atack, and the children that are trained to save it from them. One particular exceptional child: Ender Wiggin. But the book is about so much more. It's about inocence lost and hope found, it's about how much of our identity is bound by the actions we are obligated to take in do-or-die sitiations. It feels real. All the cruelty and all the kindness feels utterely human. But since it's about all the \"action\" that happens inside of Ender, and not so much about the real action, the book felt a little over-explained to me sometimes.The Speaker for the Dead: 5 stars - this book is about what happens to Ender long after the events of the first book. He is 35 years old (but it is 3.000 years after the fact, since space traveling changes the space-time continuum) and he has yet to find a safe place for the last hive queen. He arrives in a world where the only (other) sentient species has been found, and revives his own story in a most beautiful way. This book truly changed me in a deep level. The themes - survival, compassion, understanding, truth, what it means to be human - will rattle your humanity to the core (if you have any). I know it's cheesy (especially because I'm practically quoting a totally unrelated movie), but it made me want to be a better person. More like Ender, it made me want to use my intelligence in order to enhance my emotions and vice versa, instead of the usual letting your emotions take away your intelligence. It is possible, and Scott Card creates it beautifully! This is my favorite of the 5 books. In this one, even though you are thrown in to a million different characters all at once and the pace is still slow, I didn't feel confused or bored, or ever wanted to stop reading it. I absolutely loved this. It truly moved me.Xenocide: 5 stars - It is a bit hard for me to separate Xenocide and Children of the Mind, but I'll try since they are obviously separate anyhow (and my ratings show that). Xenocide starts where The Speaker for the Dead ended. As the name indicates, in this book Ender and the people of Lusitania are trying to prevent the xenocide of the Pequeninos and the Hive Queen, while still fighting for their lives. Jane gets more and more exiting and the introduction of the people of Path creates a really interesting mix.Children of the Mind: 4.5 stars - This is the end of the story. And the reason that I gave it half a star less is that - even though it absolutely satisfied me in an emotional level (I wanted things to end up well) it was a little to farfetched of an ending for me. Things just worked out too perfectly, people creating technologies out of thin air... It was very tender and absolutely humane, but I didn't buy all of it. Still, these bookes changed me and I'll carry their lessons around. The genius of Scott Card in putting cultures together and managing to keep their identities hole and their human characteristics shine baffles me.Ender in Exile: 4.5 stars - This book, as the author himself explains, happens between the 14th and 15th chapters of Ender's Game. So technically it should be read as the second book. But since it came last (and I enjoyed it that way) this is how I'll review it. This is the story about what happens to Ender exactly after the Formic war. I love how Scott Card organizes Ender's actions to be perfectly reasonable and perfectly generous at the same time. It's a beautiful lesson. But I did miss some info (that was referred to) that happened in the shadow books. I wish I had read them before I read this.Summing up: It is a great series in all aspects of it. I would absolutely recommend this.",

        "reviewDescription": "Ender's game is a great book and a must-read for any Sci-Fi fan. After watching the movie I have to urge anybody who found it lacking to give the book a shot. There's so much more to the story than could be captured in two hours.After finishing Ender's Game I would highly suggest to read Ender's Exile next, as this fits chronologically.Speaker for the Dead felt very slow to me compared to Ender's Game. It seems like a completely different book, putting philosophical and religious themes into the focus. This was disappointing to me at first, but seeing that it lays the groundwork for the next two books it shouldn't be skipped. Xenocide and Children of the Mind pick up the pace again and were more to my liking.The fact that there is no conclusion to the story arch of the Descoladores here or in any other book was very disappointing to me. It was what drove me to rush through Children of the Mind and then left me hanging...",

        "reviewDescription": "I read Ender's Game many years ago (at least 10-15). The ending made such an impression on me that when I saw the movie promo, I had to read it again.  I am now almost thru the second book (Speaker for the Dead) and still can't put it down.  Even if you don't like Sci Fi, I recommend you should read at least the first book in this series. I don't like spoilers, so I have to use cliche's. It is about \"man's inhumanity to man\" (even to children).  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  It's lonely at the top. How do you save humankind without losing your humanity?  There's some shades of the classic \"1984\"...I honestly can't imagine how a movie can capture the internal agony of the soul that Ender goes thru when each decision, each success has a terrible price.PRICE ALERT:  Do your research.  I got lucky and bought the entire Kindle quintet for $22.49.  I would not pay the $35 price listed now (not when you can buy the Kindle books individually for a much lower total)!!!  Also, due to carpal tunnel and arthritis, I'm finding it frustrating that makes me stop reading.  I now wish I'd bought the books individually, so I could get the discount for the matching Audible versions.  Amazon won't recognize the complete Kindle quintet as meeting the criteria to get Audible discount.  $12.99 each is terrible enough, $36 EACH is highway robbery,",

        "reviewDescription": "Gostei muito de todos os livros. O primeiro (enders game) e o quinto (ender in exile) são na verdade diretamente relacionados, pois cronologicamente o quinto é continuação do primeiro. Esses dois livros eu indicaria para o leitor mais jovem, como meu filho de 12 anos, que gostou muito do enders game. Infelizmente não encontrei a versão em português para os demais livros. O segundo (speaker for the dead), o terceiro (xenocide) e o quarto (children of the mind) eu considerei como uma só estória, apesar de ser possível ler todos separadamente. Trata-se do personagem Ender na sua fase adulta e portanto leva muito em conta o aspecto psicológico do personagem, sem deixar de lado a trama envolvente e surpreendente, muitas vezes, da ficção científica. Não digo que não haja falhas e alguns personagens um tanto inverossímeis, mas o que nos prende à estória é o próprio personagem Ender, com  suas nuances, sua profundidade como ser humano, e até mesmo suas falhas são tocantes, pois o trazem mais perto das pessoas comuns, sem,  no  entanto, banaliza-lo. Confesso que me interessei pelos livros depois de assistir ao filme, mas me surpreendi com os livros. Acho que os recomendaria para qualquer um que aprecie uma boa leitura, que goste do gênero, ou que simplesmente esteja aberto a uma nova experiência e não se importe em se deixar cativar por ela. Para aguçar a curiosidade dos brasileiros, aqui vai um pequeno ¨spoiler¨: três dos livros se passam em um planeta colonizados por brasileiros chamado Lusitania (!?).",

Calamity is loose, and it's been busy learning—from its time with Netty to running wild among the stars, the ultimate evil seeks nothing less than complete dominion over all space and time.\nAnd for Calamity, life is in the way.\nVan and his crew will enlist old friends, new friends, and the very beings he sought to protect from his first days as a rookie Peacemaker, fighting for the dignity of those who had no voices during the dark years of a corrupt guild.\nIt all comes down to this. And one way or another—it all ends here.\nFrom the fields of Iowa to deepest space, the final conflict will unfold with only one thing certain: not everyone will survive, but Van will give his last breath to make certain that when future generations speak his name, they will always remember one fact.\nUntil the end, he gave it all for justice, no matter the cost.",

        "reviewDescription": "I rarely write reviews.  But I felt compelled to let readers know how much I’ve enjoyed the series.  The stories are far more than space battles and neat tech stuff.  The character development is deep and the I very much enjoy the humor and banter among the crew.  Seeing them all develop as a family felt heartwarming.  Van Tudor is the kind of person I wish we could all be.While book 25 felt like the wrap of the series, I’m delighted there’s another book to come soon.  I truly hope the authors continue the series, I will be there to read them!  My thanks to the authors for an amazing story.",

The trade off is that there is more action sequences and plot development.  We do have a touch of ECO hijinx (personally I love these beetles) and the framework for additional spin off novels.All in all it's a solid 4 stars  or 4.5 even though it feels like something is missing in the secret sauce.",

        "reviewDescription": "In the last installment of Expeditionary Force, Colonel Joe Bishopran another of his specialty cons and convinced the galaxy's (hostile)senior species that the Earth (with the help of the Elder AI Skippy)had the power to disrupt the wormhole networks which enable practicalinterstellar travel.  In fact, that was not true, and the time israpidly coming when the bluff will be exposed.  In particular theAwful Kitties have dispatched a cloud of riven Jovian atmosphereto pass between the Earth & Sun, which will cause an ice age if itcannot be dispersed, and have encouraged an \"hey it wasn't us!\"attack by a client species on Earth itself.  Joe's superiors (whodon't know about the bluff) are about to order him to unleash thenon-existent kraken on the Kitties.To make matters worse, there is evidence that one or more ElderSentinel has awoken, which is never a good thing (last time tookgalactic civilization back to square -1..) and it may be Joe &Skippy's fault from the wormhole tampering they *did* do.Once again, it looks like the only thing to do is prepare for thedestruction of Earth by doing what colonization is possible unlessJoe, without his trusted XO flywheel, & Skippy can come up with yetanother plate on a stick..  and Skippy is starting to think thereis another Elder AI out there somewhere keeping them from takingany of the plates down.I thought this installment was better than the last outing, and weare now getting strong hints of endgame.  We get a number ofrevelations and a really cool (if so far unexplained) final scene.I did think the Alien Legion Verd mission was just kind of tackedon and that the humor was more strained than usual.  Also, a littleMopey Joe goes a long way, but still an entertaining outing.",

But what happens when she dies and comes back? Prepare to find out.\nListen to it because Andy Clark lays bare one of the greatest mysteries of Warhammer 40,000: the trials Saint Celestine must undergo in order to return from death....\nThe story  With her mighty wings spread wide and Ardent Blade aflame, Saint Celestine is the living embodiment of the God-Emperor’s wrath. Her halo blazes like a star upon the smog-wreathed, blood-soaked battlefields of the 41st Millennium; its holy light leading the faithful to victory time and time again. As heretics and daemons tear at her flesh, she calls down fires of retribution from on high to smite the wicked and unrighteous.\nIf she is to fall in battle, none should mourn as she is Celestine, the Living Saint, and death is her duty. Though it comes at a great cost. For each time she is slain, Saint Celestine finds herself trapped in a terrible realm of suffering and torment. There her faith in the God-Emperor will be put to the test so she may prove herself worthy of life once more.",

        "reviewTitle": "What is faith?",
        "reviewDescription": "For Celestine, Faith is a responsibility to bear and a comfort to have, a power that drives her forwards and a chain that keeps her anchored to what she must do.Faith is presented in different perspectives for different characters in this book, and all react to meeting the living saint in their own ways. Faith is central to Warhammer 40K, it's the basis of what keeps the Imperium of Man afloat, and it's the noose that tightens more and more around its neck. In the end this book reflects a fight between keeping Faith pure, and honest and free, or allowing it to turn into a festering canker, a whip, a blade that cuts in rage.The Emperor wanted to eradicate religion to avoid people turning faith into a weapon, and prevent the Chaos Gods from using it to spill our blood and doom us all. In this regard he was right, but if there is one thing that the Emperor could never snuff out, and indeed I don't believe he wanted to destroy that, is faith.Not blind, idiotic, zealous faith, but reasoning, willing and free faith.Celestine perfectly embodies this when she all but threatens the Emperor to protect Hope, lest she turn her blade on herself and never fight for him again, and in this, her faith was well placed.I enjoyed this book, a lot. It drew a lot of tears from me. I'm not a religious person and I never will be, but faith is entirely part of the human condition. Faith in each other, faith in our abilities, faith in our judgement, for some people faith in an all seeing and benevolent god. It goes beyond trust, beyond acceptance, and it is refreshing, in this darkest of days, in these waning days when the light of reason and hope have been almost entirely blocked by hate and hunger to see somebody that is capable of reigniting the flame of hope in others. Not in the zealous and almost unthinking way of the Soritas or the Inquisition, but in a way that can teach even the most hate bound creature that acceptance and love exists, and they can grasp it if they wish.The Emperor protects those that protect themselves.",

        "reviewDescription": "Celestine is a great action-drama about an immortal servant of the Emperor. As a living Saint, Celestine is a powerful supernatural warrior who can appear to aid the faithful in combat. But given the sheer scale of battles in the world of Warhammer 40k, Celestine is far from a deus ex machina. She cannot single-handedly swoop in and defeat an entire opposing army. As such, Celestine's greatest power is her natural ability to inspire and rally the Imperial soldiers around her. This makes \"Celestine: The Living Saint\"  as much about the Imperial forces who encounter Celestine as about the titular character. Overall, this is a confident, vivid, and well-paced tale. Worth your time.",

Fighting in the name of any religion is not a personality trait, it’s a disservice to what could have been an exceptional female character.Despite have the book named after her, she is very much a secondary character to whatever emperor serving male is nearby.  The battle sisters are constantly downplayed despite having a saint walk among them.If I had to sum up my review in one word it would be - ew. It so bad.",

    "bookDescription": "Best-selling authors Christopher Hopper and J.N. Chaney return with Gods and Men, book two of the Ruins of the Earth series, what fans call “the best military sci-fi of the year”, and “Galaxy’s Edge meets Expeditionary Force”. Brought to you in audio by none other than award-winning, chart-topping narrator R.C. Bray.\nHumans are herded like sheep for the slaughter, and their only hope for survival lies with a team who just left the planet.\nFollowing their successful mission to destroy the slaver ring in New York City, Wic and the members of Phantom Team pass through the Antarctic’s origin ring and find themselves deep in the heart of the Androchidan Empire. But as the scope of the alien specie’s operation becomes apparent, Phantom Team realizes they can’t stand by as humanity is culled into submission. Efforts must be made to slow the enemy’s progress, if not stop it altogether.\nUnder Wic’s leadership, the team devises a plan to infiltrate and neutralize part of the Androchidan’s operation. Allies are made, and resources are acquired. But when enemy spies find evidence of collusion, it is only a matter for time before the Phantoms’ hopes of thwarting the enemy are dashed.\nWill Wic and his elite team of warriors succeed in reversing the tide of the Androchidan invasion? Or will they succumb to the unrelenting power of the most notorious slaver operation in the galaxy?",

But I am absolutely certain of the fact that I loved the first  volume so much that I purchased all of the other books in the series.  Volume two did NOT disappoint. I am diving into three tomorrow.  Intriguing plot, excellent story arc, and engaging dialogue provides this series with heft and staying power. Highly recommended.",

You can never go wrong with any book written by Christopher Hopper & J.N. Chaney. This book 2 of 'Ruins of the Earth' series. If you haven't already, read Book 1. Do not misunderstand my prior description, 'Gods and Men' is a serious life and death conflict between aliens, humans, and other vulnerable species. You will have no problem knowing who to root for in this book.If you enjoy audible books, then you've hit the jackpot. R.C. Bray brings his skillful performance as few can to this excellent adventure. ENJOY! -Mr.Bill",

There is about as much depth as a dry lake. But, it has its moments and loveable characters. Idk, there is better stuff and worse too I guess.

        "reviewDescription": "The author has done a great job with this installment of the Expeditionary Forces. At this point we have been introduced to all the major alien species except the Rindhalu although Alanson gives us a small glimpse of their behavior patterns, just enough to tease and still leave room for surprises. I believe the story arc took an interesting and necessary turn with Emily Perkins and her band of Mavericks. Alanson is taking the time to let his readers get to know the characters that we were introduced to in the first couple of books; if all I did was read about Colonel Joe and his merry band of pirates, the adventure would become monotonous. Although, reading about Joe’s new companion had me laughing hysterically, I can’t wait to hear what RC Bray makes of that one...I have read other reviews criticizing the mannerisms of Colonel Joe in this particular series and how he is still unqualified for his role as a leader. I submit to you that Alanson has actually showed us what the burden of command feels like, when you’re down range and the proverbial @#$% hits the fan, you do the best you can with the information at hand. Sometimes you can’t call someone else and ask them what to do and you have to make it up as you go...Joe also cannot indulge himself with all the desires of his heart, his command does not allow him to “fraternize” with members of the band of merry pirates and that can wreak emotional havoc on anyone if they see everyone else finding some kind of emotional release and they are not able to, enter our shiny beer can to help out...All in all this was a well thought out novel and very fun to read. Alanson has expanded the galaxy quite a bit and it feels like revelations about the Elders will be everything we hoped for. I’m looking forward reading the next book.",

        "reviewDescription": "I have read the prior reviews and found them wildly different from positive to negative. Their is some truth in all of those reviews.. The splitting up of the storyline in of itself was fine. I did find though the Mavericks tale was to long at the beginning and disrupted the storyline. I kept wondering what Skippy and Joe were doing, but teh author mostly ignored them for to long a period in the book. Author made an error in how he almost turned the book into 2 books. The story plot continuity would have been better served to break it up in chronological pieces so that the plots could be tracked side by side. They are interlinked over the pathogen virus so this technique would have been smoother. The stars of this series are Skippy and Joe. The story itself is very good. So no disappointment there. Author would be wise to not lose track of that. The series needs more action and a move to get Earth into a more serious battle mode with its own fleet. The author needs to embrace going forward how he wrote Columbus Day. Thats was a fast action paced storyline that never bogged down. This is a very good series. This book is an enjoyable read. But it is in danger of getting stale. I give this 4 stars. Hopefully the author read these reviews.",

        "reviewDescription": "How can anyone who has read the first part of this series not like this book?  First off, repetitive paragraphs and typos are almost non existent in this book whereas I thought the previous books were rife with them.  Kudos on the writing improvement.  Secondly, everyone has been asking for more depth and character development, and this book seriously delivered by getting deeper into characters motives, intoducing new ones, and giving others more significant roles. The big gripe everyone had was that Skippy and Joe kept doing the same old same old \"problem/brilliant idea/Skippy gets frustrated/success\" rinse repeat, and this flips that on its head.There is a very good second storyline with Perkins and her crew and the overall arc does advance significantly.  You dont get the secrets of the Elders and some of the bigger reveals yet, but you can tell they will come soon.I think Craig did a great job and this was the best of the series, call me crazy.",

        "reviewTitle": "Birth of a real ExForce",
        "reviewDescription": "This book is actually two stories in one.  Both are exciting and riveting. They follow a parallel and supportive sequence. One is our old friend Joe and the Beer Can. The other is the birth of the Mavericks.  The Mavericks are a small tactical group trying to prove themselves to the Ruhar.  They run into a lot of trouble that really gives them an opportunity to prove themselves.  Joe's group is doing the bigger strategic thing which requires them to help out the Mavericks in a way that doesn't reveal their presence.  The end result is that although this is book 6 in this series, we're almost reading a prequel to the development of an intragalactic fighting force that will unite the various fighting factions.  All is exciting and interesting.  I just got through reading a set by some famous \"hard\" sci-fi writers, and it set me to thinking why I enjoyed this book better.  I like\"hard\" sci-fi, and this book doesn't get very hard.  All problems that violate the universes rules are resolved by Skippy's magic.  I decided that it was the social interaction of the characters.  We don't have characters that are stupidly evil.  Alanson's characters act like ordinary folk. Some are stupid.  Some are bureaucrats, and some are just trying to get along within their social framework. They are believable.  Hey guys, compare my 5 star to the 4 star that's getting top billing at this time, and if you think I'm more correct, please give a click on the helpful.  I don't like being buried behind someone who thinks the author should change his story line.",

Great characters and a plot that really does keep you guessing what they're going to do next, basically because the characters themselves are winging it (in a really cool way).Enjoyp.s.

    "bookDescription": "A thrilling new novel based on the Paramount+ TV series Star Trek: Strange New Worlds!While patrolling the borders of the Klingon Empire, Captain Christopher Pike and the crew of the USS Enterprise record a series of subspace echoes from a planet orbiting a volatile flare star—and when Lieutenant Spock and Commander Una Chin-Riley lead a landing party to learn more, they discover the ruins of a dead civilization and evidence of starship-grade metals…quite possibly a crash site. As they continue to investigate the strange signals, Spock and Una find shocking signs of dangerous alien life and remnants of what can only be Federation hardware. The trail soon leads Pike andEnterprise’s helmswoman Lieutenant Erica Ortegas deep into the mystery of a lost Starfleet vessel, missing in action for over ninety years—and to a terrible dilemma that will challenge the crew to question their past...and their future.",

The book is pretty good though not as good as Asylum or The High Country.  I would probably give it a higher rating but I just don’t understand what seems to be an error to me.  Why is the Denobulan Ensign Yerah referred to by the pronouns they and their?  As far as I know Denobulans are either male or female, i. e. Doctor Phlox and his family on Star Trek Enterprise.  It seems like this was just thrown in to make some kind of political statement and was very confusing.  Thus the 3 stars.",

An engaging and well-paced story, yes, organically rooted in treks past, but above all else, the author perfectly captures Anson Mount's take on Pike, Rebecca Romijn's Number One, Ethan Peck's Spock, indeed each and every one one of the principal characters/cast. Moreso than any Trek novel, of any generation, that I've ever read, this one lets you HEAR the known characters in every line of dialogue. Swallow gives fans something worth chewing on.",

        "reviewDescription": "I’m a UK Original Series TV Show watcher, who loved the novelisations from a time before VHS was commercially available. The technical manuals & production book were also great, but whilst the novels were all disappointing, I am a completist. Also, by the time of Rick Berman’s final days the show was ready for Cremation.Sadly, the mutation to a franchise, the search for a new audience & dystopian world that we are moving to have generated these novels.It’s noticeable that some series no longer publish novels & I suspect that we are reaching the last days of this type of “Merchandise”.So if you have a different view this is for you.",

        "reviewDescription": "I really enjoyed this book.  It's an amalgamation of Horatio Hornblower, Star Trek, and Tom Clancy. The British versus the Soviets in outer space. Sounds strange, but it works. I particularly liked the fact that, unlike Star Trek, there are enlisted people, and they play a significant role in the story.The battle scenes, and the military technology employed, were particularly well done.Two minor quibbles. There was altogether too much saluting. Neither the British not the American navies salute indoors. Unless you are covered (wearing a hat) you cannot render a salute. Second, it's a fallacy that there can only be one captain on a ship. U. S. Navy aircraft carriers have two, and usually three. The captain of the ship is a Captain O-6. The CAG, the commander of the air wing, is also a Captain O-6. And, since most carriers have an admiral embarked, his assistant is called the Flag Captain, and is also a Captain O-6. Furthermore, a captain in the Marines is a different rank entirely, an O-3, equivalent to a Lieutenant in the Navy. So there would have been no reason to promote the Captain of the Marine detachment to Major.The military quibbles aside, I did have one significant problem with the book, which is why I didn't give it five stars.  At around the 50% mark, Captain Halberd is assigned to go on a publicity tour, during which he has affairs with multiple women.  I found the politics boring and the sex disgusting.  I think the book would have been better without that entire episode.Nonetheless, I would read the next book in the series, if it were available on Kindle Unlimited. I'm too cheap to pay for it.",

        "reviewDescription": "This is the last in the Expeditionary Force series, a lengthy series following the escapades of an alien and super intelligent AI and a group of humans with whom he bonds over the previous 6 volumes and many dangerous escapes from other nasty aliens all while trying to save earth and humans. Written tongue in cheek and with one of the most amusing sets of characters, from the alien AI (often referred to as a beer can) and a self-deprecating human hero to the many other characters that populate the series. My whole family loves Skippy the AI, especially as read in Audible. I tend to read the books so I’m a huge fan of the writing and of this author who’s other books are just as easy to read and just as entertaining. I admit sometimes the technical sci- jargon gets in the way of the fi- but I’ve really enjoyed the series and would wholeheartedly recommend it. I’m a Virgo though and get bogged down occasionally in detail and the detail that annoys me about the series is that there are too many grammatical errors that make one pause for a second or throw the impact of the story. However, as that’s my only complaint and is easily remedied by the publishers it gets a full thumbs up.",

        "reviewDescription": "This review is a general one for books 3 through 7 there may be some spoilers for earlier books, but if you arehere, you probably read them.I reviewed the first two of these books last month.  This is theremainder of the series to this point.To reiterate, the basic setup of the series is that in the aftermathof the departure of the Elders, there is an ongoing, apparentlyendless, interstellar war drawing in all the known intelligent racesof the galaxy.  There are two coalitions, each headed by a seniorspecies which has mastered some of the Elders' toys, with a pyramidof technologically inferior species under each senior race.  Oneside is, basically, the bad guys and each species in that coalitionworks as much to screw over their supposed mentors and allies asthey do against the good guys.  Unfortunately Earth got chosen tofight on this side, and we are so far down on the tech pole thatwe barely even count as cannon fodder.Sent with the UNEF to the planet Paradise by our Kristang \"allies\"to do essentially mall-cop level duties by evacuating Ruhar \"enemy\"civilians from Paradise after it changed hand from Ruhar to Kristang,US Army enlisted man Joe Bishop comes into contact with a stillfunctional (though somewhat arrogant and ADD) Elder AI he christens\"Skippy\" who will help Joe, and by extension, Earth if Joe will getthe (non-self-mobile) AI off of Paradise.With an unlikely team, and monkey cunning, Joe's \"Merry Band ofPirates\" have managed to exterminate the Kristang occupying Earth.Unfortunately it is vitally important that no race of either coalitioncome to realize that Earth is a) free & b) has a spaceship andlimited Elder tech.  This leads to wilder and iffier missions tokeep the secret, and means that the UNEF on Paradise can never betold that the homeworld is OK.Two books & a novella here basically deal with the situation onParadise: _Paradise_, \"Trouble On Paradise\" and _Mavericks_.Basically, without ever contacting anyone on Paradise, Joe's teammust maneuver events so that the Ruhar take back the planet, becauseotherwise the Kristang will massacre the humans of UNEF as traitorousallies.  With that done, a tenuous detente trending towards friendshipblossoms there (the Ruhar are basically OK guys, though there aresome jerks of course) and may lead to something new in the age oldwar.  This sequence is generally well done, though the framing storyof Joe's Pirates in _Mavericks_ is a bit forced.The other books are tales of the increasingly frantic efforts by Joe'steam to keep the rest of the universe from noticing that there is anythingat all going on on Earth.  This is not helped by Skippy being taken downseveral notches and dealing with species several steps higher on thetech tree.  Along the way, the team gathers alarming information onthe state of the Universe, and indications that \"Everything Skippy knowsmay be wrong\".  The final (as yet) tale deals with Joe's decision togo it alone after being a consummate team player, something that can't helpbut have major repercussions.As before, these are engaging tales full of puzzles, humor, hairbrained plans that work, hair brained plans that don't work,arrogance, humility and the continuous prospect of the end of theworld as we know it.

        "reviewDescription": "You see, Joe is rescued back to the Flying Dutchman along with some of the Merry Pirates and a few volunteers that were hanging around at the time, and with the help of Skippy, conscripts some delta force guys who were trying to take over the Dutchman on behalf of the USA.  The Maxolhx are sending two warships to investigate strange things happening at the local wormhole.  We know this is the fault of Joe and the gang from the previous adventures.  Joe is given three impossible tasks to perform in order to save the Earth.  This reminds me of Jason and the Argonauts.  I personally would have tried to avoid the three challenges, and would have tried to incite a war between the Maxolhx and the Rindhalu, but no, our Skippynauts accept the three challenges which require the Skippynauts to sneak behind Maxolhx lines and invade unbreachable security to pick up a pixie, steal a Maxholhx dropship, and get word from an unmanned communication outpost that can only be approached by a Maxholhx ship with a pixie.  Once these three challenges are met, the Skippynauts are to destroy the two Maxholhx warships using the decrepit Frankenstein ship known as the Flying Dutchman.  You won't believe how all of this is accomplished through the awesomeness of a beer can and the ingenuity of a band of monkeys.  He who can manipulate micro wormholes can do anything!  The story is still exciting, and the Beer can is still amusing even though he's gotten a bit more mellow.  I will be reading the two more follow-on books, but this one felt like a formula with the three challenges",

I still couldn’t get RC Bray’s voice for Bishop out of my head, though.  Fantastic series.  Imaginative, serious where it counts and fun and playful everywhere else.Humanity facile a dark threat and this is handled in a way without the book becoming morose.  Every page stings to the next and it is a captivating read.  Occasionally the dialogue between Bishop and Slippy gets a little routine but isn’t that how dialogue with a friend often goes?If you are a fan of imaginative sci if that still gives you the tech stuff without going overboard then you will love this.",

He also manages to include occasional thought provoking ideas, and just a smidgen of social commentary.  If you want good escapist stories that are hard to put down, I strongly recommend this series.",

On the wrong planet, at the right time, for the best reasons, Hadrian Marlowe started down a path that could only end in fire.\nThe galaxy remembers him as a hero: the man who burned every last alien Cielcin from the sky. They remember him as a monster: the devil who destroyed a sun, casually annihilating four billion human lives - even the emperor himself - against Imperial orders.\nBut Hadrian was not a hero. He was not a monster. He was not even a soldier. Fleeing his father and a future as a torturer, Hadrian finds himself stranded on a strange, backwater world.\nForced to fight as a gladiator and into the intrigues of a foreign planetary court, he will find himself fighting a war he did not start, for an empire he does not love, against an enemy he will never understand.",

        "reviewTitle": "Fantastic Start to a New  Space Epic",
        "reviewDescription": "Empire of Silence, the first installment in Christopher Ruocchio’s Sun Eater series was a highly entertaining read and a great start to a space opera series. I have seen a lot of criticism of Mr. Ruocchio’s work, claiming it is entirely too derivative (if not a near replica) of Patrick Rothfuss’ Kingkiller Chronicles, however, other than the use of a framing narrative (which is not exclusive to Rothfuss) and some common themes (which, frankly, are common to many sci-fi and fantasy works in general) I don’t see Empire of Silence as being overly derivative. Honestly, I see a lot more Dune inspired references than anything else – which I rather enjoyed.Empire of Silence effectively uses a framing narrative, in which Hadrian Marlow opens the story by telling the reader he is known as a hero, a villain, a murderer, a savior, and the man who eradicate an entire species and killed a sun. After Hadrian “introduces” himself to the reader, the story opens as he recounts his early life as a privileged scion of a powerful family and the internal turmoil he feels between duty (family) and his heart’s desire (to be a scholar). After the latest in a string of arguments with his father, 19-year old Hadrian is destined to be packed off to the Chantry – the religious type order that controls the empire’s technology and is not afraid to use torture to get what it wants. Hadrian, horrified by this turn of events, attempts to flee his fate, but (as is wont to happen) things don’t go to plan and Hadrian finds himself penniless and abandoned on a strangle planet where, through a combination of wit, guile, and luck he manages to find himself entwined in empire political intrigues and hidden secrets of the Chantry.The world building was top notch, with the reader’s knowledge of the empire, its planets, inhabitants (human and non-human), technology, history, and political structure expanding as Hadrian learns of these things. I especially liked the blending of sci-fi with fantasy and the use of the Roman Empire as a basis for some of the political/military structure.While information was presented through structured lessons, conversations, or as an aside as “older” Hadrian expanded on a certain point it never felt like an exposition dump. I credit that due to Mr. Ruocchio’s skill as an author; while there were certain passages that felt a bit . . . clumsy, the novel’s overall prose was a lovely balance between straight forward/direct and poetic – with the poetic passages being (mostly) limited to Hadrian’s inner thoughts, reflections, and mediations (which makes sense considering he wanted to be a scholar).Since this is a first person POV narrative, I always take the characterizations of others with a grain of salt since our narrator’s basis and personal feelings certainly will cloud his perceptions. I did enjoy the characters that Hadrian met; I thought they were all interesting, allowed for Hadrian to do some soul searching, and moved the story well. While the pacing was a bit slow, the story was never dull.I greatly enjoyed Empire of Silence and look forward to continuing on with the series.",

From early on, I was hooked, and I did not want to put it down at all. I think what got me invested is that it was a very story-driven plot, but also a character-driven experience as well, following the early life of our main character, Hadrian.I really felt a sense of connection with Hadrian. The storytelling is from his perspective and viewpoint of everything that's happened as he remembers. And within the first few pages of the book, you know the ending of the series, but the journey on how we get there and that personal view is what's fascinating to me.The world-building was vast, detailed, and overall just enjoyable! There's a ton here from the different planets, alien interactions, political intrigue, religions, and the different ranks and setups of societies. It was very detailed and was very easy to explore and understand.Overall, I had a blast with this book. It would have been an easy 5 stars for me, but there was a little bit of the few middle chapters that slowed my experience down just a bit. But it was still very enjoyable, to say the least. If you've been on the fence on whether to start this series or not, I say go for it. I've heard this is the weakest of the series, so I'm extremely excited for the rest!",

        "reviewDescription": "The book was exceptionally well-written. The world-building, highly detailed descriptions, characters, and plot were all great.However, I think the book is almost too long. The highly detailed descriptions, at times, become overly wordy, creating a pacing problem. Don’t get me wrong; the author’s vivid descriptions and details clearly illustrate his vision. But at one point in a chapter, the tension was high, and the wordiness was excessive. We were in a tense moment, and now wasn’t the time to be describing the armor’s painting details. I was on the edge of my seat, waiting for action, not needing more details.Despite this minor issue, I highly recommend the book. It’s a grand space opera with significant inspiration from Dune, Star Wars, Star Trek, and Red Rising. If you enjoy any of those three, you’ll likely love this book. I’ve heard that the subsequent books in the series only get better, and I eagerly anticipate continuing the series. However, due to its length, I’ll need a palate cleanser book or two before diving back in.",

        "reviewDescription": "EMPIRE OF SILENCE is One of the most amazing reading experiences of my life.  It’s so good that I’m tempted to read it again before starting book 2.Defining or containing the story of the life of Hadrian Marlowe to a single genre fails to do the story justice and fails to give due credit to Mr Ruocchio.  It’s Uber epic hard core sci-fi mixed with high fantasy that effortlessly rolls of the tongue of the reader, glides off the screen of your kindle, and runs off the page of your paperback. The writing itself is a work of art. Easily matching the quality of Rothfuss (NAME OF THE WIND), watching H Marlowe rise, fall, and rise again, and even struggle to exist, is something you will never forget.Characters come and go. Some get sacrificed, we don’t know if they live or die. It’s not unusual either to find yourself emotional at a given turn of events.  And To be completely honest, it must be said, the story chugs a bit in the first half.  You might be tempted to give up then. Don’t.  Please. Don’t.Technology as a character doesn’t play a major role in EOS. There’s an Easter egg to Star Wars in the finale and even Mr Ruocchio has compared the life of his main character to that of Anakin Skywalker at a pivotal moment of his life. But this ain’t no Star Wars story. That’s like comparing an ant hill to the Grand Canyon.Mankind’s enemies are the Celcien and they are portrayed as evil incarnate by those in power and in control of the lives of the masses. But by the books end you will be in a position to see the forest for trees  and see humanity for what it is.So THE SILENT EMPIRE is a truly great story, taking us an expedition that will teach the reader what it means to be human. It rises above genre classification and sits with aplomb in the company of the greats of pure literature.  What more needs to be said? Absolutely nothing.",

        "reviewDescription": "Vanguard Strike is a sci-fi military space drama. I am not a big military or sci-fi person, but was sent a widget for this book. I read the synopsis and said what the heck, I need a genre mix up. I’m so glad I did too. This book was so good. The action, the characters everything was well done.What I liked:The action. This book was almost non stop action. It didn’t drag at all.The world building: the world was well built and easily understood.Easy to read: One of the big things that turn me off of sci-fi is how wordy and technical the authors can get. This book did not do that. I understood everything easily and without having to go back and try to decipher what I was reading.The characters: I loved these characters! Lax was well wrote and multi faceted. The side characters had personality and you cared for them.There were only a few things that I found fault with. One was the almost romance. It felt forced and I didn’t really like the woman who was the love interest. We were supposed to relate with her, but I just didn’t feel her. I also may have missed it but I don’t understand how the two ships connected. It may be more explained in the next book. The chapter present or past labels. This may be more of an editor thing but sometimes the chapters whipped forward or backwards without telling us where we were in time. Hopefully in the final draft that will be fixed.Lax is, was a Vanguard, a mutated military soldier made to destroy. Once Paragon won the war, Lax was released from service and became a vulture (a scavenger) for space ship parts that brought in money. After a disastrous run, Lax ends up in prison. While in prison he’s contacted by an old friend for a new job. He agrees and starts a new journey filled with violence, politics, and lots of shooting. Will LAX and his new crew survive this one final job?A delightful action packed novel that is a must read for any sci-fi fan.Thank you to Second Sky and NetGalley for the arc.",

Great action, a likable rag-tag crew, found family, government secrets, and antagonists so terrifying that you don’t want to imagine them in real life.I can’t wait to see more character growth and what adventures the crew will have as well as the mysteries they’ll uncover in the next book.",

        "reviewDescription": "This book is amazing.The first half of the book was excellent. It was some of the same old Joe and Skippy that we like.Then the middle 5-10% was very boring, with too much dialogue.The last half of the story was a \"side story\" that I didn't feel detracted from the main story. I know some reviewers didn't like it, but the aliens in this story have been fighting for hundreds of thousands to millions of years. War isn't always over immediately. Space is vast, and there are millions of consequences.Then came the ending. And did it blow my mind. There were so many revelations. For those who feel frustrated that the story is the same over and over, the end is worth the wait. I think in the next book, the story will be moving along at a much faster rate. The alien threats will be expanded. The survival of the entire galaxy is at stake.I like Craig Alanson's writing because Joe, the main character, is stupid. He has his flaws, and he often rambles on. But he always comes out ahead, and when you least expect it, when things don't go according to plan, he innovates. You really feel like you're in the main character's shoes. When he laughs or cries, you feel it, and hope he comes through.I was tempted to take one star off, until I read the ending. This book is not edited, but even then, it's hard to tell. There's the occasional missing period, or sometimes sentences can be a bit wordy. Other times, I couldn't tell what was happening, and I was confused.But the fight scenes and science are still very good.I wish there was a glossary of all the names, because it's getting harder to remember all the wormholes and planets.There's one or two situations where Joe Bishop is a little ignorant, such as naming something \"Hadjistans\", which is a little racist.If you're wondering if you should get this book or not. If you're tired of the series. Please keep reading. The $5.99 price is worth it because you get 570 pages.I can't wait for book 10. Things are going to change.",

Nice light-hearted jokes, killer bedsheets and my fav uncle Edgar. Then... signs of the forthcoming banter about feelings began sneaking in. By the second half (the rescue op) the story becomes rather dull, and all of a sudden it explodes in your face with Skippy's revelation and the imminent death of everyone - and then THE END. I personally understand pretty well what the author had in mind with a set-up like this, BUT and it's a capitalized BUT - I now have a pretty good idea what'll happen in book 10. And worst of all, the Maxolhx investigation mission storyline (Illiath) just vanishes like it never started at all. Nevertheless, I'm NOT giving up on the story (hence 4 starts, not 2) and will be buying the next book. But something about storytelling needs revising, in my opinion.",

Believe me…I am going to be first in line get book 10.  I thought the entire book was a great read and it is showing that Alanson is sharpening his craft as these books progress.  This book had a tad less burdensome dialogue and far more action.One of the story arcs that I think Alanson is trying to build up to is that saving Earth will be less important than saving the Galaxy; seriously, you have to put things in perspective.  But, it appears that saving the Galaxy will have the ultimate consequence of saving Earth…but bareley.  Once again, It will come down to the “Law of Unintended Consequences.”If you want a spoiler for the title of the final book in the series, I predict it will be “Joe and Skippy Save the Galaxy!”  Alternatively, the title could be, “Skippy the Magnificent and Some Hairless, Smelly Monkey with Gray Mush in His Skull Save the Galaxy!”  I guess it boils down to if Joe or Skippy actually name the book; but, I think I prefer the latter title.I don’t actually read the books; rather, I listen to them through Audible.  The narrator, R.C. Bray is outrageously entertaining and this voicing of Skippy is absolutely spot-on perfect.  Seriously, this book is a wildly entertaining read.",

        "reviewDescription": "Loved this book.  It's the first in the series to which I've given 5 stars for the overall story.  I actually listened to the audio version, even though I also bought the kindle version.  RC Bray always gets 5 stars from me, but the story is usually just good...not great.  This one kept me on the edge of my seat much of the time.  It was nice to really get to know some of the supporting characters and to understand them better.  I was also glad Craig was able to bring in new characters.  I'm looking forward to Book 10 to see if we continue to enjoy them or if the insane AI of the Valkyrie snuffs them all out....whew...!",

        "reviewDescription": "De vorige boeken werden steeds slechter - het bleef maar doormodderen over hele lange onmogelijke opgaven die uiteindelijk (je wist het al na een poosje) toch steeds lukten. In een vorige recensie had ik al geschreven dat het nu echt 'op' was volgens mij en dat het terug moet naar het echt interessante deel: Skippy en The Elders. In het blog van de schrijver stond later nog iets dat het negende boek (deze dus) echt het antwoord zou geven op alles en de laatste uit deze reeks zou zijn. Dat is waarschijnlijk deels waar...In Valkyrie weer een heel verhaal over 'onmogelijke' opdrachten (veel hoofdstukken na de 30e heb ik snel bladerend doorlopen, het gaat weer over een aktie op een planeet) komt eindelijk (in een snelle twee bladzijden!!) de achtergrond van Skippy en zijn relatie met de Elders - daarna volgt een cliffhanger en is het boek uit.Wat een vreselijk boek, wat een vreselijk einde en daarmee wetende dat de schrijver WEER een nieuw boek zal schrijven over Skippy & co..... Het wordt er niet beter op.Advies, ook aan fans van de eerdere delen, koop dit boek niet, het zal je zwaar tegenvallen.",

        "reviewDescription": "WTF and You've got to be kidding me!Those were my initial responses to reading the last line in the 9th novel of the excellent Expeditionary Force series written by Craig Alanson. Many a time a TV show has left you with a season finale cliffhanger that has you cursing the writers and producers but it's rare in a novel but Craig has managed to do so with Valkyrie. Naturally I am intensely interested in how our favoured characters are going to get out of this situation but it really did put a damper on the immediate joy of christmas after putting the kindle down. On the upside I needed a stiff drink so swings and roundabouts.As for the novel itself, well after the terrible toll taken by Armageddon the Merry Band of Pirates have risen to the challenge and addressed the cold fact that Earth may indeed burn but any small victory is a victory when you consider the incredible obstacles a whole galaxy can throw up against them. I've got to admit the beginning of the novel had me laughing like an idiot which is no small feat given the low point (plot wise) we were in but it all kinda makes sense and that's something Craig proves himself capable of time and time again when creating situations and solutions to entertain us. Naturally Joe and the rest of the pirates face the dilemma of using their battlecruiser to maximum effect when faced with a senior species who begin to ask the right questions as to who is striking their ships but when intelligence indicates a few hundred human prisoners are being sold for bioweapon research there was never any doubt no matter what they risk they would find a way to help.Valkyrie is without a doubt a valuable addition to the series and draws a line in the narrative, where is goes from now only Craig knows and while I have some trepidation I'm along for the ride.",

        "reviewDescription": "The Murderbot Diaries world is expanding to include several new character cast and I was delighted to get a short story from Iris' point of view and time with her, her crew, and A.R.T. on a mission adventure.Rapport: Friendship, Solidarity, Communion, Empathy is #7.5 in the Murderbot Diary series, but chronologically takes place just after the events of #2 Artificial Condition. Rapport picks up with A.R.T.'s crew and some scholars on a mission to a Corporate Rim Station to investigate some artifacts a section of the station rumored to be Pre-Corporate Rim.There is always danger when entering the CR for a mission and this is no exception. Iris needs to be on her game, but she's distracted. Something's been up with Peri since he came back from his last solo mission.Rapport is short, but it is mighty. I loved the further insight into the Corporates from Iris' perspective, seeing her and the crew on one of the missions ART told SecUnit about, and also seeing from the inside the relationship between Iris and ART. A fabulous interlude in the grand story arc.",

        "reviewDescription": "Reviewed on Good ReadsOne of Martha Wells' Murderbot fragments- very short stories that serve mostly as accents to the main series, rather than any major addition to it. The two previous story fragments were \"Home: Habitat; Range: Niche; Territory\" and \"The Future of Work: Compulsory \". They are all worth reading, imo, though frustratingly short.This one is not about Murderbot directly but centers on his friend ART and ART's crew, who we met in the last two novellas.. it's only 34 pages (e-book) but the story and writing are good enough that I wished it were a full blown novella or at least a real short story.ART and company are on another mission to mitigate the indentured servitude of the Corporate Rim, where hostile takeovers are *really* hostile.We get more details about the Corporate Rim and ART that provide context to the whole series but it's so brief that any plot discussion verges on spoiler territory.I liked it but it felt too much like a teaser to be really satisfying.",

A war like no other.\nWhen the research starship Galileo vanishes without a trace, the powers-that-be are quick to bury the incident, eager to prevent escalating tensions that could lead to war. As a former POW, Soren refuses to give the ship up for lost.\nHis daughter is one of the missing.\nTaking matters into his own hands, Soren starts pulling strings and calling in favors, determined to launch a clandestine mission to bring Galileo home. When an old friend offers him a ship for the operation, he expects a rusty relic headed for the scrapyard.\nInstead, he's given the Wraith—an unfinished, experimental starship with plenty of potential and just as many problems. A marvel of engineering…if his crew can keep her running.\nThey’d better.\nBecause Galileo’s disappearance is just the beginning. War is coming to the Federation from the most unlikely of places.\nAnd Soren may be the only one who can stop it.",

All the basic elements were there, just an issue of word smithing an ending which drew me in to want to buy the second in the series.",

And if Oltyx is to save his precious Ithakas Dynasty from the barbaric war-cult known as the Imperium of Man, he must become the kind of king he never expected to be.

There is a complex plot which is interwoven nicely making it not only exciting but also very readable.  You want to know what happens next at every turn.  The author has also done a great job of explaining what is happening, aspects of characters and also the technology aspects in the book.  No detail is left unattended from the actual science aspects to the creative plot that mixes interstellar business, traditional science fiction and very detailed military action.  I highly recommend reading this book.",

        "reviewTitle": "Another Interesting Act in this Sweeping Space Opera!",
        "reviewDescription": "If you have read the first 3 books in this series, you already know that this series is truly a space opera as the subtitle suggests - grand, a bit pretentious and pleasantly moralizing about the human condition.  Revolution succinctly tells the tale of what happens when life gets too good for a society’s citizens - they tear it down.  All the volumes have been amazingly engaging - it is hard to put down.  Imaginative, and with a lot of action sequences- and most importantly the author keeps things moving, with no long slogs through exposition that plagues many other long multi-volume series.  Character development is light (in keeping with opera) and the technical aspects plausible enough not to distract.  Well done, Mr. Bartlett!",

They+re young, they+re fast and strong, and they+re totally without normal human qualms.The universe is a dangerous place for humanity-and it+s about to become far more dangerous. Three races that humans have clashed with before have allied to halt our expansion into space. Their linchpin: the turncoat military scientist Charles Boutin, who knows the CDF+s biggest military secrets. To prevail, the CDF must find out why Boutin did what he did.Jared Dirac is the only human who can provide answers-a superhuman hybrid, created from Boutin+s DNA, whose brain is uniquely able to access Boutin+s electronic memories. But when the memory transplant appears to fail, Jared is given over to the Ghost Brigades.At first Jared is a perfect soldier, but as memories surface, he begins to intuit the reasons for Boutin+s betrayal. As Jared desperately hunts for his -father,+ he must also come to grips with his own choices. Time is running out: the alliance is preparing its offensive, and some of them plan worse things than humanity+s mere military defeat . . . .",

        "reviewDescription": "Series Info/Source: This is the second book in the Old Man's War series.  I borrowed this from Kindle Unlimited on audiobook.Thoughts: I enjoyed this but not quite as much as the first book in the series.  I think the wonder of this world and the humor in the first book just really blew me away.  I did enjoy still getting to see Jane, but this story focused  more on a Ghost Brigade soldier (Jared) created from the consciousness of traitor to humanity, Charles Boutin.I continued to enjoy this world and really enjoyed learning more about The Ghost Brigades.  We meet a mostly new set of characters in this book, although Jane and Harry are in and out of the story some.  I enjoyed Jared as a character but not as much as I enjoyed Perry and crew in the first book.We do get a much broader story here about the CDF versus three other alien races.  We also get exposed to some intriguing questions about the CDF and their motives when it comes to human interactions with alien races.  Additionally, this book focuses a lot on The Ghost Brigades themselves and what it really means to be human.I didn't think this was as funny as \"Old Man's War\" but there is some humor throughout.  I listened to this on audiobook and really enjoyed the audiobook narration.  I would recommend listening to this on audiobook if you enjoy audiobooks.My Summary (4/5):  Overall I liked this.  I didn't think there was as much humor in this book and didn't enjoy the characters in this second book quite as much.  However, I did enjoy learning more about The Ghost Brigades and delving deeper in to this world.  I also really enjoyed the broadened storyline around the CDF and the three alien races joining forces against humanity.  I look forward to reading \"The Lost Colony\" soon.  I would recommend to those who enjoy science fiction with some intriguing space travel, aliens, and a look into what it means to be human.",

Craig’s getting better, of course - best way to get better at writing is to write. Betcha his planning helps too.Still in cheapskate mode, I discovered that our local library found Craig popular enough to have ExForce on the shelves, so i read #3 on my tax money. They didn’t buy 3.5, so here I am.One of my measures is how much I skip because the writing gets tedious. FAR less this time, and I have every expectation that trend will continue.This may be my last ExForce review, as the library bought ‘em all, which I hope serves as a compliment to Craig’s talent. Thank you, sir, for what continues to be a wonderfully fun ride.",

Great big ideas (love that), some redundancy in writing (acceptable, given a need to recap 3.5 books at this point), and much more attention to proper punctuation and grammar (improved proofing has helped a lot--first two books were a real mess grammatically--mostly punctuation). Good story, almost standalone, but much better if you've read the first three books.  Missed Skippy in this one though. Character development is getting better, too. Recommended, but don't expect Iain Banks-level quality (yet). This series has a lot of potential.  Some of the best military SF out there now, in that it's quite fresh and up to date on our actual early 21st century tech.",

        "reviewDescription": "As the book is in English like all the main-books, here's my review in English aswell!The obvious one first: This book may be a spin-off, but it is highly recommended to read books 1, 2 and 3 before starting this one.The story is all about UNEF on Paradise and it starts a few days before the end of book 3. And then it continues to tell a story of some of the characters currently stuck on Paradise and what happens after the end of book 3. In my opinion it was really enjoyable to read, although it was shorter compared to the main books. Nevertheless this doesn't affect my opinion at all.I bought it for 0,99€, which is well worth the price for what you get. If you enjoyed the parts of the main books playing on paradise and if you want to see more of the Ruhar-Human-relationship developing, then I highly recommend this book!There's not much more to be said without giving spoilers, all I do say is: It has the same writing style, funny parts and serious parts as well, nothing really differs from the main books. And for my part: I would like to have more of those 'short-spin-offs' telling the story of UNEF. I really enjoy reading about humans and Ruhar and I am really looking forward to what this relationship is going to develop.",

What could be cooler than an inquisitor on the run for a crime he didn't commit? Not much. How much is Eisenhorn willing to compromise himself – and his closest friends – and risk his soul for a chance to clear his name?\nThe Story:\nA century after his recovery of the alien Necroteuch, Gregor Eisenhorn is one of the Imperial Inquisition's most celebrated agents. But when a face from his past returns to haunt him, and he is implicated in a great tragedy that devastates the world of Thracian Primaris, Eisenhorn's universe crumbles around him. The daemon Cherubael is back, and seeks to bring the inquisitor to ruin - either by his death, or by turning him to the service of the Dark Gods.",

        "reviewDescription": "It used to be the rock...now its the Fluffernutter...If you know the former then you'll recognize the latter when you get to it.So I'm giving the book 5 starts, I really feel that it should only be 4 but the factor that makes it 5 for me is that I feel satisfied and happy with how things progressed and resolved and I'm already reading it again to find all the little details I missed the first time through, that alone makes it a 5 start book to me.To try and stay as Spoiler free as possible I will say only this, DAMN! OK, maybe it needs a little more than that.Valkyrie ended on a massive cliff hanger that was sort of like the biggest WTF moment of the whole series, seriously, Monkey's were losing their sh@t over this left and right! I liked seeing the fallout of that and the repercussions of that and how Craig told that story. The moments of despair and desperation, the feeling that you've lost all hope then to have it dangled in front of you like the carrot on the stick. I liked how it was resolved and the way everything sort of came together, it did feel a little too fast in some instances and I would have liked to see some of those interactions and plot bunnies exploited a little further but at the end of the day I was happy with how the story started and moved forward.As I was reading through this one a lot of the key moments call back to events in earlier books,, that is not a bad thing, most authors do throw out comparative or comparable events from time to time as a way of tying things together throughout such a long running series; the way Craig does it I much prefer to how some other authors do it. I don't need a page and a half recap of something that happened 3 books ago when a single line does the trick.  That is all part of knowing the audience and Craig definitely knows his audience. As we learn more about past events and triggers in the overall story prompt refreshers they are done in a way that is unobtrusive and don't detract from the story, if anything they get integrated into the story and actually help move the plot along.Critical Mass takes the story in a direction that we seem to have been doing everything possible to avoid for the last 9 books, yet it makes sense when we finally go down the rabbit hole; everything has been building to this and the truth shall come out at last.As usual there is a lot of the typical back and forth banter between Joe and Skippy but as Joe matures as a character and the experiences define the character further, the juvenile aspect of Joe and Skippy takes a back seat; don't get me wrong, its still there and its part of the story, but its less of a story element now and more or less just there. Skippy is still an A$$hole though, that will never change. We get introduced to a couple of new characters in this one and a lot of familiar faces are just as prevalent in the story as they have been, some might be surprising but they are a welcome addition, I can't wait to see how this all turns out. We also see a lot of character development in minor characters as they take on a larger overall part of the plot, something we were sorely lacking in Renegades and Armageddon.How the book ends definitely threw me for a loop and I actually screamed by my tablet when I read the last few chapters; Joe casually saying to the reader, \"oh yeah, I skipped some details, I should explain\" my response was 'YA THINK!!!\" and quite possibly the biggest deepest breath and sigh of relief I've ever felt.I enjoyed it, I'm reading it again, my wife enjoyed it, shes reading it again, its just good fun and anyone who tells you otherwise, well that is their opinion as this is mine. I know at this point some readers and worn out and just want the series to end because its getting repetitive and predictable; to a point they are correct but I'm still able to be surprised by some of it and I still find myself thinking, \"how are they going to get out of this one?\" I also find myself learning things, like tap codes... so take it for what it is, enjoy it and TTA!",

        "reviewDescription": "This author has not only an interesting, imaginative storyline which will interest hard core science and physics enthusiasts, but he also has a great sense of humor.  Joe Bishop and Skippy the Magnificent (the ancient AI) are absolutely laugh-out-loud hilarious.  RC Bray is an outstanding performer and he makes the audiobook entertaining beyond belief.  In the first book, I thought, \"this is just a weird, cheesy story\" and I almost stopped listening to it.  I am glad I stuck with it.  At first, it seems a little cheesy, but you quickly realize it is not.  It is a great blend of science, humor, military strategy/tactics, and Albert Einstein.  Any serious science fiction or military fan will love it.",

        "reviewDescription": "After the HUGE and unconscionable cliff-hanger at the end of the last book, he at least leaves the story in a much better place. It's also gotten more interesting again after sputtering along in the last couple of books from one disaster to another, ad nauseam. If not for the HUGE cliff-hanger, I probably would not have read this one. Note to author: that's a cheap and dirty way to treat your readers. DON'T do it again.ALSO -- I REALLY wish that you would take your writing seriously enough to learn proper sentence structure. You repeatedly leave awkward, run-on sentences lying around on the floor for your readers to stumble over, leaving us to our own devices to sort out the meaning. It's sloppy writing and disrespectful of your readers. You're making a lot of money when we buy your books; show us a little courtesy and clean up your writing. HINT: use semicolons or conjunctions in long, complex sentences. Don't just slap a bunch of phrases together with commas and move on.",

        "reviewDescription": "Alanson has improved almost every aspect of his writing. Over the course of the series, I would get tired of constant reminders and summaries of previous books. It felt like filler and it was almost like the author didn't trust his readers to remember previous books. There are still references to previous missions, but the filler is gone. It was a welcome and refreshing change of pace.Characters developed well. Alanson tries to add additional dimensions to well estanlished characters, and he succeeds. Traumas should be traumatizing, and the characters react believably to what they experienced in earlier books. The addition of a new character added fresh comic relief that was very welcome. Banter is funny and snappy and has been a consistent strength in the series.As always, events are wild and unpredictable. I've never been too great at predicting what will happen next, but Alanson is particularly good at resolving problems in unexpected and exciting ways.Overall, this book is fantastic and showcases Alanson's growth as a writer and storyteller. It was so good I finished it less than 24 hours after purchasing. I was weary after Valkyrie, and this book has left me energized and excited for the next installment.",

    "bookDescription": "The bestselling adaptation of the iconic video game Halo: Combat Evolved featuring the Master Chief—part of the expanded universe based on the award-winning video game series!2552. Having barely escaped the final battle for Reach against the vast alien alliance known as the Covenant, the crew of the Pillar of Autumn, including Spartan John-117—the Master Chief—and his AI companion Cortana, is forced to make a desperate escape into slipspace. But their destination brings them to an ancient mystery and an even greater struggle. In this far-flung corner of the universe floats a magnificently massive, artificial ringworld. The crew’s only hope of survival is to crash-land on its surface and take the battle opposing the Covenant to the ground. But they soon discover that this enigmatic ringworld is much more than it seems. Built one hundred thousand years ago by a long-lost civilization known as the Forerunners, this “Halo” is worshipped by the Covenant—a sacred artifact they hope will complete their religious quest for supposed transcendence, and they will stop at nothing to control it. Engaging in fierce combat, Master Chief and Cortana will go deep into the Halo construct and uncover its dark secret and true purpose—even as a monstrous and far more vicious enemy than the Covenant emerges to threaten all sentient life on Halo and the galaxy beyond…",

        "reviewDescription": "I must admit that I am a huge fan of the Halo game franchise. The universe, story, characters, and the game play/multi-player is something to love. There is one thing that a game just can't cover. Details. Playing through the game gives you a story line seen mostly through they eyes of Master Chief and his AI Cortana. I would always wonder what else was going on when I played the game. The book allows you to see everything from multiple characters, even the Covenant. Details that in my opinion, bring the story together perfectly. There is an abundance of fighting which seems somewhat redundant,but you have to remember, it's Halo. There are so many other side stories that fill in the gaps for people who play the games. It's pretty cool to be reading the book and trace you own steps and experiences that you had in the game. You can literally picture every turn and remember the enemies and the situation at that time. I certainly makes the book very enjoyable. I did notice that the enemies in this book seemed inconsistent with the enemies from The Fall of Reach as far as how tough they were. Like someone had said in a review I read, if these books had a difficulty level, The Fall of Reach was legendary and The Flood was normal. Regardless, I enjoyed the read and I am very eager to continue reading the other books!",

        "reviewDescription": "I love Sci-Fi and the Halo series of books are some of my favorites. I purchased the Kindle version, the paperback version and the Audible version of this book. I have read or listened to it multiple times. For me it never gets old.I like this book a lot but there are several things that bother me. The audio book and the Kindle version do not agree word for word. It is like the Audible version has been corrected and updated while the Kindle version has not. Words, sentences and paragraphs have been added in the Audible version while the Kindle version is incorrect.The other item that bothered me is the weapons used in the book by the humans and the effect they had on what was shot. The Master Chief use a shotgun a lot and the Kindle book said it was an 8 gauge shotgun and it was a 12 gauge. Parts of the Audible version were corrected while the Kindle book is still incorrect regarding the gage of the shotgun. In addition the book always talked about the assault rifle blowing large holes  through the aliens that were shot. High velocity assault weapons and 7.62 bullets don't do that. They pass though the body. I also wondered how many magazines the master chief could carry. He must of used many thousands of rounds of ammo.Don't get me wrong but I still like the story. It is just that being a shooter I could not relate to incorrect information regarding  the weapons. I like the book and I rated it 4 stars. It would have been 5 stars if the storyline moved faster and the above mentioned items were correct.I don't play the game but the story line, of the book,  was entertaining  for me and I liked it. Like I said, I have read and listened to the book multiple times.",

        "reviewTitle": "A mixed bag, but worth it if you're a big fan of the series...",
        "reviewDescription": "...and I do mean if you're a BIG fan of the series. I'll say up top that this book definitely isn't for people who aren't into the series on a \"I consume the expanded lore\" level. Not because I'm trying to gatekeep, or because only people well acquainted with the lore will understand the plot; but because, to put it frankly, it kinda drags for most of its read-time. As a direct novelization of the game Halo: Combat Evolved, most of the plot in the book is re-treading the exact plot of the source material. And by direct, I mean direct. Where in a video game, repeatedly shooting aliens in hallways can be loads of fun, it is much less interesting to read about someone shooting aliens in hallways. And this is often handled in such a way that the words start blurring together. The chapter that covered the level \"The Library\" was particularly grueling, with pages of text that all could be summarized as \"He shot the enemy, then moved forward and shot more enemy.\" Almost all of the parts covering events in the source material read this way, which admittedly can be neat at times - particularly in how some events and environments are described in ways that make me go \"oh, I remember that exact room/combat encounter/etc.\" But overall, most things dealing with Chief reads like a play-by-play of someone's playthrough of the game, which is less than interesting.This is contrasted, however, by the parts not focusing on events presented in the game, which are well written and fun to read. They don't always hit spot on, and in particular the scenes of fighting tend to get bogged down, but William Dietz's capabilities as an author shine much brighter when he's unshackled from pre-established events. Of particular note are the side plots concerning Yayap, a grunt working for an elite headhunter with a mission to hunt down Chief, and Lt. Melissa McKay, a marine leader coordinating and fighting in the resistance against the covenant. Both are quite fun, and I enjoyed them a lot.Another thing of particular note is the personality given to the characters, and the overall energy and tone of the book. They all feel particularly \"mean\" or \"angry\" or just \"off\" in some way or the other. Its Halo, so of course death is a common occurrence, but a lot of the killings feel mean-spirited or particularly cruel in how they're described, which is an odd thing to hone in on for a book about war, but I noticed it a lot over my read and it really didn't feel to be in the same vain is the more serious action in books like \"Fall of Reach\" and \"Contact Harvest\" or the more fun, not-afraid-to-be-playful feel of the games like Halo 2 or 3. Well established characters like the Master Chief and Cortana also seem \"off-model\" so to speak in their characterizations, with the duo's relationship feeling more full of anger toward each other rather than the sarcastic, yet supportive rapport they are known for having. I can't really blame Dietz for his mischaracterizations too much though, seeing as how this was quite literally the third piece of major Halo media ever released. There just wasn't that much there to guide things like tone and personality, and while the gleeful violence seems more Doom than Halo - and definitely not to my liking - I can respect the situation the author was in when this was written.Overall, while I like a lot of the additions to the story of Halo this book brings, the overall package isn't something that I can see people enjoying too much unless they're looking for those additions in particular. If not, you're better off playing Combat Evolved.CONS:- The action is monotonous and boring.- Lots of telling you what happens instead of showing.- The tone is weirdly angry and cruel.- The established characters don't really feel like themselves.- You've already seen the main plot if you've played Halo: CE.PROS:- Some of the side characters and their stories are interesting and fun. (This is what made me choose 3 instead of 2 stars, by the way. There are some very good times to be had in the B plots, just not enough to make the whole package good instead of mediocre.)- We get to see a more complete view of the battle that takes place in Halo: CE.- It is canon that Chief drives the warthog into the building in \"Silent Cartographer.\"",

        "reviewTitle": "Another great addition to an incredible series! Can't stop reading",
        "reviewDescription": "Another good one! Brushfire was exactly what I hoped for—packed with action, humor, and the kind of intergalactic trouble that only Joe Bishop and Skippy the AI can get into! The story hits the ground running with new twists and plenty of banter, which kept me laughing and turning pages. If you're already a fan of the Expeditionary Force series, this book won’t disappoint. It’s more of the same epic space battles and clever dialogue that makes this series so addictive. Definitely a fun read for fans!Alanson's imagination is mind-blowing. This series is so long, and I can't begin to imagine having the talent to write a series that has kept me engaged this far into it. I'm not an astrophysicist so I can't attest to this, but the space travel and battle physics seem very plausible to me, which further enhances the series. I'm not left feeling like it's unrealistic or 'fanciful.'If you like sci-fi and are open to a good dose of comedy and human interaction interspersed, I highly recommend this book and the series.EDIT: added a fan image of Skippy. Not perfect, just a first stab at it.",

        "reviewDescription": "This book, 11th in the series, started off well. Plenty of action \"out there,\" but then it bogged down and wallowed in the middle with what seemed a load of fill up padding. It started reading like a romance novel, (not that I ever read those). So much so that I found it a chore to keep reading, but pressed on, thinking that this was the final book in the series and wanted to see how it all ended - more about that later. I'm glad I did keep going because the action revved back up again and Allanson's inventive mind (or was it Bishop's or Skippy's) came up with a highly imaginative chain of events that I would never have expected. As I mentioned above, I thought this was the last book in the series because of what the author had said when he first launched the ExForce series. In fact, book 10 was supposed to be the finale, and I quote from an email that I received from Craig in June of 2016 as the authority, \"The Expeditionary Force series has ten books mapped out. The last two chapters of the tenth book has (sic) already been written...\" Still, I enjoyed book 11, mostly, and look forward to #12. Will it be the last, I wonder?",

        "reviewDescription": "I can't understand how one person can keep churning out so many great books. The stories are not only some of, if not the, most entertaining titles I've ever read. They're FUN to read! I never had any idea how closely I could relate to a science fiction story in space, but this one is set in current times with 'regular' people, trying desperately to understand and utilize the unprecedented technology they've been tossed into. The author explains the science and technology in a very understandable way without getting lost in endless detail, partly because the protagonist is just a common Joe who needs things dumbed down for him. And so FUNNY! This author is probably the most sheerly entertaining that I've ever read. The only truly bad thing about the books in the Expeditionary Force series is getting to the end of the last one and waiting for the next to be released. Well, that and that one awful audio book in the series. I couldn't stomach listening to it. But fortunately the subsequent books did a decent job of synopsizing what happened in that one. I can't recommend this book series highly enough.",

Please keep it that way, mathmatical formulae and astrophysics already have books and those can be read just before bed to ensure a quick transition to sleep. Craig has nailed the verbal sparring/ interaction that help makes the military tolerable to the enlisted. This is coming from someone who served 11 years in two different branches of the armed forces. Yes, I was dumb enough to do it twice, yes you should thank your lucky stars that someone is, because you can still read this book at home safely. No I wouldn't go back and change a thing, end monolgue.To the author, keep at it your freakin' killin' it. I love the characters, the sass, their interplay and especially the sarcasm, bc without it, life would suck and we would be stuck with mathmatical formulae and theory. The story and plot are solid, but not super important to me, because I have seen great ideas suck via poor writing/ characters/ interplay. Your work has now become a common reference amongst my entire family (also the extended) and we all truly look forward to the next release.",

Oh and I know that we have all heard about the lead person serious lack of romance with a certain person he has in mind, but that might change in this book, well .......maybe. I have to say it amazes me how the narrator comes up with all of the different voices for even the newest characters.........Now I look forward to what will happen in the next book.",

Dialogue seems kind of stilted no matter who is talking, but attempting to keep Morgan acting like a newbie gets in the way.  He seems so brainless for a combat veteran with a rank of sergeant.  I'd expect him to quickly use the simulator to make himself indispensable.  Also, what happened to Campbell?  I would have expected her to bring some reason into the story to counter the captain, but she goes off the rails, and starts taking attitude, and being disrespectful.  The story is improved, but we've diverted away from the original concept that the story is about the sergeant Henry Morgan.",

All this because Earth has noticed alarming activity out in the stars.  Humanity has built the first and most advanced spacecraft ever built to investigate and hopefully stop the systematic destruction noted out by Alpha Centuri. The trip will take in excess is 82 years requiring the crew to go into cryo sleep on a 10 year rotational basis. They need a “human” mind that can think out of the box (no pun intended) and not tire.  AI’s can’t.  They can only do as they are programmed.  Sounds great!  But no.  The captain hates AI’s. Others have put an AI inline to monitor and restrict Henry.  What can go wrong?!There is drama, strife, hopelessness, loss and a whole gamut of issues form the crew and Henry.  I really like how the author humanizes Henry, including how can a human mind remain sane in an environment where there is no sleep, no one to talk to due to the crew in cryo, other than a “by the book, unyielding AI that can’t recognize serious issues!Sorry for being long winded.  In short… this is a good book to read!  Enjoy it!",

The other issue was the Marine group who would purposely damage or obstruct equipment, including theft and used to keep them alive is also hard to follow.

Harry’s reconstruction as a space ship’s AI continues in this absorbing read. Plenty of space combat and a plethora of Aliens all make for an absorbing read. I have already pre-ordered number three in the series.",

Suddenly the small Earh ship performs against overwhelming force whereas the friendly aliens seem to be incapable of defending themselves. Henry gets a bit of dialogue in at the end and does some human (not remotely AI stuff) towards the end which saves the day.Absolute waste of time.",

        "reviewDescription": "Book 12 is a rollercoaster ride with the usual Skippy comedy and the technical rabbit out of the hat solutions by Bishop. The Skippy jokes continue to be funny though are a little repetitive. It might have been better to have actual situation comedy rather than just hints. The drama of escaping the apex species onslaught is riveting and I am quite amazed at the plot brilliance. But there is a big BUT over here. This is book 12 out of a series of 12. Surely the ending could have been grander and fulfilling. Only one aspect of the book's plot is given closure. The eventual fate of the central character is just ignored and the ending is a failed attempt at tragi comedy involving side characters whose adventure is only beginning but snuffed due to the author's hurry to close the book. There is no sense of satisfaction of the 'happily ever after' syndrome because of so many loose ends. That is why I have likened it to a sumptuous meal with a burnt pudding. The end is clustered and doesn't do justice to such a long and enduring series. I strongly suggest that the author do a triology in which he shows how humanity achieves the apex status, the side characters violent ending is not only shelved but their goals are achieved and the central non human character whose existence makes the book possible reaches the fate he has aimed for since the beginning. If not then the author runs the risk of downgrading his own series himself.",

        "reviewDescription": "Ich liebe diese Serie wie keine Andere. Alle Daumen und große Zehen ganz weit nach oben!!Buch 12 der Serie, viele Details erübrigen sich an dieser Stelle somit. Kann die kritischen Punkte mancher Rezensenten nicht widerlegen, Geschmackssache, aber ich kann sie auch nicht teilen. Mich hat jedes Buch, so auch dieses, gepackt und mitgerissen. Böses Gegenbeispiel, David Weber und seine Honor Harrington Reihe - die letzten Bücher habe ich mich nur noch durchgequält, zig-seitenweise langweilige Dialoge die zu nix führen, die ich dann spätestens bei den letzten Beiden oft überflogen habe.Alanson streut für meine Begriffe immer wieder frische Ideen ein, bleibt klar auch einer gewissen Linie treu, aber die Geschichte ist immer noch und immer wieder überraschend und lebendig. Aus emotionaler Sicht und Bindung zu den \"Helden\" bin ich sowieso von Anfang an voll an Bord.",

        "reviewDescription": "The 12th novel in the Expeditionary Force series by Craig Alanson is titled \"Breakaway\" and humanity despite having galactic scale weapons of mass destruction have been easily maneuvered into a very bad position by the senior species of the galaxy, races that have had millenia to perfect their craft. The Maxolhx having engineered the approaching global ice age that is currently affecting the Earth and by extension vastly increasing the threat of humanity turning on itself are maybe a little too complacent as Joe Bishop, Skippy and the rest of the Pirates do their best work when forced into a corner and once again we see imaginative and intelligent scifi story telling which allows our heroes not to be swept aside. Not only that the Mavericks and Colonel Emily Perkins having been fully absorbed into the main narrative and are working their own military magic to strengthen the position of Earth and weaken the two main coalitions that control the galaxy. This novel really hit the ground running and never let up, good scifi story telling with strong characters both new and old and alien races which have purpose and add greatly the whole. Personally I loved the Jeraptha and their Ethics and Compliance Office but we also get more of the apex species interaction with humanity and other races which was very satisfying. Breakaway was an excellent read, loved it, love the series and well up for the next novel.",

Ignoring inconsistencies in the capabilities of various things that should have been caught by the author as well as anyone lending it who’s read the earlier books, this one was rife with missing words , mixed up sentences,  and conversations where at some point, a bit of dialog must have been left out, because the two people talking switch, someone gets two ones in a row punctuated like it’s a change in the person talking, so it gets confusing.But the story was great, on par with  the earlier books for sure. Great to see the merry band back in action.",

        "reviewDescription": "Another fun book even without most of the Merry Band of Pirates. There was a lot more review of past shenanigans in this book as it is the first one since the supposed end of the series.  It was a bit odd in that sense compared to the other books, but at the same time it was nice to have the review. A lot has happened over time and while most of it stays in the memory pretty easily because of how crazy it is, there are one or two things that it's nice to have a review of.  There seemed to be a lot going on in the background that would just randomly pop up in the story. That part was a bit odd, but overall the story was still a lot of fun.",

        "reviewDescription": "I absolutely LOVE this series! I wait and watch the release date getting closer and closer until it’s finally uploaded.  Most of the time it’s a binge read because I usually can’t put it down. However, this time the release was during the holiday season and so my experience was different. Not in a bad way, just different. The storyline was excellent, as usual & the character’s performances wonderful.  The one thing in this particular book that is different from all the rest in this series is the amount of errors not found through prerelease editing.  I would be willing to bet there are more in this book than in all the other books put together. That is a major discrepancy, a divergent from this author’s other books. It’s just not usually like that. I can only guess that he was rushing to hit the release date, which is unfortunate, but the good news is this issue can easily be remedied with a digital update. ( uuuuh….I’m totally guessing that’s an easy process, but it may not be or it might be costly. I’m not sure.) A printed correction is a whole different affair, I’m sure.  Besides that one issue, bottom line, it’s a great story, as usual. Skippy the Magnificent is back and ready to take names!To the author:My kindle is broken so I read this on my iPhone. Unfortunately, the iPhone kindle app does not have the same ability to send a correction/comment (with each encounter as you read) to authors as the actual Kindle. (Someone needs to tell them to fix that!) The only way to make corrections was in the highlights portion so that’s what I did. If you can access those comments in the highlight section then you have my permission (if needed) to access them. I hope I found them all and will save you some time and headache. If you can’t access them then I could probably send them to an email as a copy from my Notes section. Just let me know.  👍",

Many of his \"contemporaries\" struggle with simple grammar rules(sounding like the cookie monster) or actual science, so it's a breath of fresh air in a field of literature that is filled to the brim with mediocrity, and mediocre is a very generous measure.  Most of the mindless science FANTASY being produced in massive quantities doesn't deserve a review so give this series a read if you remember the classic authors that created a genre and helped guide generations of dreamers!",

Also, some of the chapter breaks just make no sense, they just cut off in the middle of a scene, and then continue that scene with no time having passed.Overall, it feels like this is an early draft, where the story overall is solid, but there's still a bunch of stuff that needed work that just didn't happen. It feels like nobody did a final pass to correct for all these errors. I thought the author hired an editor? It sure doesn't seem like it with this book. I get that it's self-published, but the earlier books in the series had far less mistakes like this, but it's been growing over time.

        "reviewDescription": "I have loved this series since it started. When the story arc of the first 15 books ended, I was sad it had come to an end, but very glad I'd taken the ride on Craig Alanson's imagination and writing. His announcement that he had another five books in mind boosted my moral immensely, and #16 has exceeded my expectations. Sort of - I trusted Craig's awesomeness, and just like Skippy, he delivered. Reader's who've read the series will know what I mean.For those who haven't read it yet, strap in for one of the best romps of adventure, pathos, and fun (especially the blowing up stuff parts ;) ) you will ever read. Aliens invade the Earth, and humans are drug into a millenium long war, needing to find a way to survive. The universe discovers it it not prepared for what us monkey's can do, especially when we're assisted by the last viable AI of the elder race.The aliens are alien, but relatable. The main characters, even the bad guys, are realistic and grow with time. The plot twists keep it fresh and exciting. Craig's writing style will take you on a roller coaster ride of tension, ups and down all over the emotional spectrum, and the humour on nearly every page will have you laughing so hard and loud, people around you will wonder if you're in your right mind. If you're reading the series, you are.Yes, you have to start with book 1 (Columbus Day), but once you start, you'll be hooked. Just Trust the Awesomeness.",

It had once saved the woman's life by massacring her attackers in a particularly bloody manner. It believed the man to be a lost cause. But not even its machine could see the horrors in his past.

        "reviewTitle": "Expertly-constructed; dense and opaque",
        "reviewDescription": "Having just finished reading this novel for the second time, after the first time about 25 years ago, I’m revising my stars from 5 to 4 because, while the novel is very well constructed, it is also a difficult read. It took me several weeks to slog through the first 90% of the book. It was just very difficult to follow what was going on, and how the several scenes and storylines were related. 25 years ago, when I first read this novel, I was in college and I was actually a English major and maybe back then I was more available and open to this kind of dense literature. But now in my mid-50s, maybe I’m just tired of having to work so hard. The conclusion is the apex of the story, and that’s what I have remembered about this book for 25 years. But the twist — and here’s a spoiler — that our narrator is unreliable, I do not remember from 25 years ago. So that was a nice surprise, and made me want to go back and read the whole damn story again to find out if there were clues to this twist, and also to revisit the alternating chapters to see if I can find out who is the real protagonist.So, while the story is extremely intriguing and dense, I just don’t think I have the time and energy left in my days to slog back through this novel yet again and actually do the investigation that this powerful story warrants. I shall, perhaps, do some web research to see if others have already done the digging for me.",

        "reviewTitle": "The Snark was a Boojum. So what?!",
        "reviewDescription": "Oh, Noes! Drizzle (I can’t pronounce and refuse to spell her actual name) must be interrupted in her role as The Kardashian Who Arranges Peace Conferences, and even has to cut short her seduction of a pale, hip, new Artist, because She is The Only One who can convince Zalkawe (or something like that) to help, and Zalkawe is The Only One who can convince whatzisface (I completely give up) to help, and watzis is The Only One who can, by power of sheer inner moral persuasion, convince an entire star cluster from having itself a nice religious-ish interstellar war.Poor Drizzle. She even has to leave behind her cute little space bunnies. (I swear I am not making that up.) But not to worry, her instantly-created double, with all her memories, will take care of them. And fill in as The Kardashian Who etc. But no sex for the double, because Drizzle is a spoilsport.If you’re wondering why they are The Only Ones, forget it. No explanation in the book that I could fathom. That’s just a skyhook on which to hang a bunch of fairly inventive and actually enjoyable adventure fiction that is presented in two separate streams: Space adventure in Drizzle’s universe of the Culture, with its 30-kilomeer superintelligent and hyperpowerful spaceships, as Drizzle finds Zalkawe and leaves wide open the question why he was supposedly so hard to convince; and a second thread of roughly WWI/WWII-technology war fiction, with some incongruous but fun elements, in the Zalkawe thread and the part after finding watzisface, which also leaves wide open the question of why watzis was so hard to convince.The two threads run in alternating chapters, with the old-timey (“primitive”) ones numbered in roman numerals, running backwards, which those old-time episodes also do in time. (I’ve heard people complain that they were confused by this. I strongly advise them to grow another brain cell.)The two streams roughly meet in time at the conclusion. At that point, an ultimate, universe-shattering, plot-destroying, non sequitur occurs, the source of my title. Unfortunately, that will have to remain unexplained here, since to talk about it would be a MAJOR SPOILER and I’m not into writing those.I originally picked up this book because it was recommended by China Miéville, a wonderful fantasy author (Read!! “Perdido Street Station” Read!!) who also happens to be an avowed and active Socialist. He recommended it as a depiction of a perfect socialist state, obviously referring to the Culture. I had no idea what that could mean, so I got the book. All I can say is: Well, China, I guess so. There are passages in which Zalkawe has the Culture explained to him. The only thing standing out to me is this: Despite how meaningful people’s actions are said to be to them, I end up not seeing much use for humans in the Culture. They’re all just Kardashians. Or Kardashian wanna-be’s.Actually, I’m personally starting to have a hard time finding much use for Banks. His books just seem very interesting in the title, jacket, promo material, etc., but for me they regularly disappoint, just seeming… bland. Suburbia in space. I find more sense of wonder, of strangeness, in one page of, say, Alastair Reynolds than in all 500+ pages of “Use of Weapons.” ”Inception” came close, I will admit, until near the very end when, as in “Use of Weapons,” the entire point turned into something bland and/or just incomprehensible.But never the less, the middle 300+ pages of “Use of Weapons” are an easy read with some rollicking adventure, as they say, so enjoy as you will. Just don’t expect any real consistency or motivation. I never felt bored; just disappointed.",

        "reviewDescription": "Very few times do I put a book down and then exclaim \"that was deep\".  Well, this was one of those few time.  I read UofW years ago, and I re-read it a few months back, and now I can say that the re-read (and knowing in advance how it ends) brings out another measure of depth that previously went unnoticed.Above all, it is a very carefully written book. It is crafted to have the reader continue to guess after each chapter about the outcome of the story as well as the origin of the main character (Zakalwe). This practice, at times is stressful, because Banks is very good at misleading the reader and even at time purposefully confusing us just to build up the suspense for another upcoming chapter.  Several others have mentioned the forward and reverse timelines, and while I see why this story was told in this unique fashion, I also realize that Banks is not fully transparent in the reverse timeline. In fact, at one point, Banks jumps from one 3rd person viewpoint to another, and he does so in a fashion that is both abrupt and discordant, but by the time this happens you (at least I didn't), don't care because by then you are fully committed to finding out why Zakalwe tortures himself for the sake of a micro-managing galactic civilization which he holds in some disdain.Forward or reverse, it doesn't matter, when it boils down this is pretty much the story of Zakalwe: his life, his philosophy and his numbing/excruciating pursuit of his one and only goal. The Culture in this story, represented by a drone and Diziet S'ma, (who is a major character in another Culture novella \"State of the Art\") function mostly as facilitators and enablers for Zakalwe. Unlike other Culture novels, where a specific concept within the Culture is explored or even some policy decision within Contact or Special Circumstance is brought to question, here you get none of that. While it is a bit of false advertising, trust me, it won't matter.  The story has such a powerful message and such a Shyamalan-like ending that you almost forget that it is set in the Culture universe.There also seems to be an agreement, that UofW ends in a cliffhanger. I don't think that is true. Re-reading the whole book and then carefully reading the prologue and epilogue (in that order) explains exactly what happens to Zakalwe. A great story which also provides adequate closure, what more can you want?...maybe 5+ star rating.",

Two parallel plot-lines each containing intricate details about cleverly drawn characters in brilliantly rendered narrative eventually collide in a stunning denouement.

        "reviewTitle": "A Riveting Prelude to Galactic Conflict",
        "reviewDescription": "In the vast expanse of science fiction literature, few works stand as tall and as influential as *Horus Rising* by Dan Abnett. This novel, the opening salvo in the epic *Horus Heresy* series, is nothing short of a masterpiece, deserving of every one of its five stars.From the moment readers dive into the pages of *Horus Rising*, they are transported to a universe teetering on the brink of cataclysmic conflict. Set in the grim darkness of the far future, the novel introduces us to the sprawling empire of the Imperium of Man, ruled by the enigmatic God-Emperor and beset by threats from within and without.At the heart of the story lies the primarch Horus, beloved by his brothers and revered by his legion of Space Marines. As Warmaster of the Imperium, Horus is tasked with leading humanity's crusade to conquer the galaxy in the name of the Emperor. But as tensions simmer and betrayals brew, Horus finds himself torn between loyalty to his father and the seeds of rebellion sown by dark forces.One of the greatest strengths of *Horus Rising* is its rich and immersive world-building. Abnett effortlessly brings to life a universe brimming with detail, from the war-torn battlefields of distant planets to the labyrinthine corridors of the Imperial Palace. Every aspect of the setting feels meticulously crafted and authentic, drawing readers deeper into the story with each turn of the page.But perhaps the true triumph of *Horus Rising* lies in its characters. From the noble warriors of the Adeptus Astartes to the scheming politicians of the Imperium, each character is rendered with depth, complexity, and nuance. Horus himself is a particularly compelling figure, a hero torn between duty and ambition, grappling with the weight of his destiny and the whispers of darkness that threaten to consume him.Abnett's prose is equally impressive, combining visceral action with introspective moments of reflection to create a narrative that is as gripping as it is thought-provoking. The dialogue crackles with wit and tension, driving the plot forward at a relentless pace while also providing insight into the minds of the characters.In conclusion, *Horus Rising* is a tour de force of science fiction storytelling that deserves its place among the genre's greatest works. With its epic scope, richly drawn characters, and masterful prose, it is a novel that will linger in the minds of readers long after they have turned the final page. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the Warhammer 40,000 universe or simply someone looking for a gripping tale of heroism and betrayal, *Horus Rising* is not to be missed.",

        "reviewTitle": "Great Epic Story!",
        "reviewDescription": "This is a great start to an amazing series based on the Warhammer universe.  The character development is very engaging, and the world settings are rich and emersive, giving a very enjoyable juxtaposition to reality, allowing the reader to completely engage with the story.This is a violent setting and may not be suitable for readers under the age of seventeen.  There are no explicit scenes and no foul language, though. Instead, the author develops the story using classical literary writing techniques that are a breath of fresh air in this age of pop fiction.I would strongly recommend this book, and I look forward to continuing this epic adventure.",

        "reviewTitle": "“I was there the day Horus slew the Emperor.” – A Riveting Tale of Ambition and Betrayal",
        "reviewDescription": "As someone new to Warhammer 40,000, I approached Horus Rising with hesitation. Could a novel about genetically engineered super-soldiers in a dystopian future hold my interest? Dan Abnett’s gripping storytelling turned that question into an emphatic yes.The story follows Horus, the Emperor of Mankind’s chosen Warmaster, as he leads the Great Crusade to unify humanity. Told through the eyes of Captain Garviel Loken, the book explores the camaraderie, moral dilemmas, and cracks forming within the Imperium’s seemingly perfect vision.What surprised me most was how personal the narrative felt. Despite the epic battles and vast scope, the characters – especially Horus and Loken – are richly human. Horus is both inspiring and flawed, burdened by immense responsibility, while Loken’s introspection and growing doubts make him a compelling guide through this universe.Abnett’s worldbuilding is immersive yet accessible, striking a balance that welcomes newcomers without overwhelming them. The grim, gothic atmosphere of starships and the philosophical debates surrounding the Emperor’s secular vision add depth to the action. The battles themselves are brutal but purposeful, advancing both the story and the characters’ arcs.Themes of loyalty, faith, and ambition resonate powerfully, making the book more than just military sci-fi. It’s a tale of humanity’s fragility and the cost of idealism.For newcomers, Horus Rising offers a thrilling, approachable entry point into Warhammer 40,000. It’s a story of epic scale grounded in intimate, relatable struggles. By the end, I was captivated and eager to see how the haunting opening line – “I was there the day Horus slew the Emperor” – would unfold.A must-read for anyone who loves stories of ambition, betrayal, and the weight of destiny.",

        "reviewDescription": "I'm over 50, and I've only ever played a few dozen games of Warhammer in my entire life, and all those games were in the late 80's when I was gifted 'space hulk' for a birthday. The game was lost in a house move a couple of years later, and that was that!What I'm getting at is I'm no gamer and I've not attempted to paint a miniature since my Genestealers and Blood Angels from 'Space Hulk' were physically assaulted by my paint brush as a teenager.However, what I do like is science fiction, both film and novels, especially when a great deal of time, thought and effort has been invested in the lore around that particular universe, e.g. Star-trek and Warhammer 40K.I'd been looking for something to read recently as I'd been off work with an injured back and I came across the HH set of books online. I did about 60 mins of wiki reading to get the bare bones and thought I'd give the first book a go.You know you're onto a winner when you sit up waaay past bed time, saying \"one more paragraph, ok just this chapter\" 4 nights in a row. Yep....4 days and I'm a slow reader who likes to keep checking the index to keep up with who is who, however, I need not have worried as the myriad of character names are repeated often enough for them to sink in, which going into the book was my biggest concern.My second concern was, did I know enough basics? and the hour on Wiki was more than enough, as the author pitched the book just right, telling the story, and injecting the appropriate amount of historical reference where necessary, and it had me gripped.Abnett's  descriptions of fight scenes are excellent, but one thing I didn't expect, which was a massive bonus, was the amount of humour in the book, and this is where Abnett excels in character building.I'm not going to bang on about the contents, I'll leave that to the experts, I'm here to convince those like me that it's not a heavy book, it's very enjoyable and entertaining and I've downloaded books 2&3 already!Enjoy!Jon  (hubby to firechick)",

    "bookDescription": "Siege of Terra, Book 2\nThe Solar War is over. The Siege of Terra has begun. As the Traitors unleash their deadliest weapons, the defenders of the Throneworld face nightmare and plague - but Terra must stand.\nListen to it because: discover the lengths to which Horus will go to claim Terra as his own - and the horrors he is willing to set upon its defenders.\nThe story: on the 13th day of Secundus, the bombardment of Terra began. With the solar defences overcome through the devastating strength of the Traitor armada and the power of the warp, Horus launches his assault on the Throneworld in earnest. After withstanding a ferocious barrage of ordnance, an immense ground war commences outside the Palace, with every inch gained paid for in the lives of billions. The front lines are beyond horrific, and the very air is reduced to poison and blood. Bodies are thrown into the meat grinder, but the outer redoubts cannot possibly hold for long, even with the loyal primarchs to reinforce them.\nFor Horus has his own generals to call upon. Between the plague weapons of Mortarion and the fury of Angron, the defenders face a losing battle.\nWritten by Guy Haley. Narrated by Jonathan Keeble.",

        "reviewDescription": "It's my belief to write on certain subjects in Warhammer 40K, you must be one of the golden children. They won't simply select a little-known author or relative nobody; like the Primarch series, the Black Library bends its most talented wordsmiths to the task and expects the very best in results.This book is a prime example of that. Every situation, every encounter, every plotline brings you to the room almost as if you were living these times of crisis. You feel the sadness of Sanguinus, the hatred of Mortarion, the fear of Imperial citizens, the foolishness of the lost and the damned; you whoop for joy when the Khan rides, rememer your own fond moments when Sanguinus appears and feel the sadness of potential destroyed when Horus is on the page.The books shows a hideous, awful side of war that so many Warhammer books touch upon but so few bring to life; the misery of the Imperial citizen caught in a battle of titans. Here, though, it's worse; this is betrayal as it happens, the realization that not even the very best of us can resist temptation and ego.Another reviewer - Kid Kyoto - whines and sniffles about the pace of the book. I promise that you will not be bored; in fact, each subplot strengthens the story and keeps you in suspense as each grand plan of attacker and defender comes to light.This book is hard to put down, and it will be one you will not regret reading.",

Not how he had been portrayed in Warhammer novels before the heresy series began. Now seeing the development of an astute warrior, with his own code of honour, which is setting him upon the path to the Black Legion and the future Black Crusades.",

        "reviewDescription": "This book was solid like the \"Solar War\". It details the bombardment from Horus' fleet as well as the first traitor landings on Terra's soil. The emphasis is placed on the conscripts which is good as we get to see how they are forced to defend their homes from unimaginable horrors. However, there were some aspects of the book that brought down the narrative.Spoilers below for the book.First with the negatives:Black Library editors somehow missed the fact that Dorn met with Vulcan near the end of Nick Kyme's \"Old Earth\" novel when the latter arrived on Terra. Somehow, this was retconned out of existence and Dorn is surprised along with his other brother primarchs when Malcador reveals Vulcan is alive during the war council meeting at the beginning of the story. I could not help but roll my eyes.I thought Perturabo's outbursts to be unbecoming for the famed Lord of Iron. Sure, the primarchs do act like children but Perturabo usually has a lot of restraint and here he comes across as a spoiled brat. However, his banter with Angron was entertaining.Myzmadra's arc was brought to a bit of a disappointing end with her whole undercover operation meant to blow a defence Bastion of the loyalists to let the traitors through. Ok...The stare down between Angron and Sanguinius near the end was a bit unnecessary because it is a tease that this particular primarch v. primarch duel will happen in future books. Except it is more entertaining when there are no teases and when the moment comes, it is sudden and a welcome surprise.Positives:Gendor Skraivok getting destroyed by Raldoron was one of the most satisfying things I have seen in the entire Horus Heresy series. It was pretty nasty seeing how Skraivok got possessed by the demon of the sword however.The three loyal primarchs each shine in this book despite their minimal page time with Dorn coordinating the defences, Sanguinuis providing hope for the defenders, and the Khan riding out like a boss. I especially liked how Sanguinius saved the Khan from the Death Guard and the mutual respect forming between these two demigods.The conscript Katsuhiro was a relatable character and his arc was good even though he had a bit too much plot armour.The tragedy of the Heresy is seen very clearly with the appearances of the World Eaters and Death Guard who have by this point gone off the deep end in their slavery to their patron gods. Even Horus himself is but a shadow of his former self which Abaddon greatly dislikes.",

When the Skrull seal themselves inside an impenetrable energy dome, McGill knows he has to get creative. Even if that means sabotaging alien power plants, blackmailing his superior officers, and using his own troops as bait in a deadly game of cat and mouse.\nBut the real enemy isn't the dome, or even the Rebel Blue Skrull forces trying to overrun the planet. It's McGill's commanding officers, who are looking for any excuse to execute him for insubordination. Now McGill has to pull off his riskiest gambit yet—turning certain defeat into victory while staying just barely on the right side of mutiny.\nRage World is the latest action-packed entry in B.V.

While not a lot of substance to the story - the campaign was almost an afterthought this time around - it was refreshing to see some old names make an appearance like Kivi, Natasha and Della.  The author also moved the story decidedly in a direction that suggests the next books will be pretty good.  Rage World is a good boost for a series that was getting stale and predictable.",

        "reviewDescription": "The Farmer series was just a wonderful series of escapades.  \"High Tech\"; AI; furious beastly predators; evil scheming villains; heroic good guys; some PG romance; miracles that \"save the day\"--it had it all.SO...with proven capability in his art and his audience, the author expands his story and his core themes with flare and competence.  Old friends resurface; new allies are found; loaded with \"PEW PEW PEW\" battles; hints of BIG THINGS SIMMERING--just a fun romp.  It's a quick and easy read, and it held my attention until the end.  If you want deep thinking, explorations of philosophy, evocative/profound description, etc, then go read War and Peace [I dare you to finish it; I didn't].  But to \"get away from it all\" and KNOWING that truth and justice and honor will always win in the end, you can't go wrong with this.  Eagerly awaiting the next book in series.",

        "reviewDescription": "One of the author’s skills is effective world building. Combined with excellent character development, this results in truly enjoyable stories. While the new series is able to stand on its own, it’s linkage to the earlier Star Farmer and Pirates of the Milky Way creates a broad, fascinating universe in which his characters can evolve and develop. Highly enjoyable read - and I’m definitely looking forward to the rest of the series! Especially as the new books will drop frequently - minimizing the waiting for the next/continued adventure.",

There are some fantasy elements here too, with the outer space version of Imps, Ogres, and Trolls making an appearance. Some well placed appearances by Tom Savage help tie everything together.This is a really fun read and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.",

    "bookDescription": "The Emperor's daughters are coming to the Frontier...with an illegally seized warfleet for unknown purposes. They are raiding for supplies, or receiving them from sympathizers as they cut a path across the Empire encouraging all who will listen to rise up and overthrow their father. Whether they be allies, enemies, or something else is unclear, but the Emperor has loaned a large Mainline Fleet to Aatroxiss for him to use to stop them if the Imperial Fleet cannot, and with so many traitors in their midst, it looks like Visha and Victa will make it to the distant Frontier within approximately two years of their public rebellion. Grand Admiral Aatroxiss knows better than to let them get into the Frontier, so he waits for them to get close to the border then takes High Admiral Greganin's fleet out to confront them.

        "reviewDescription": "Archer Devereaux can't get a break.  An up & coming young navalofficer in the Phlegraean fleet, his career took a nose dive whenhe was found sleeping with the wife of his commanding officer.  Hehad no idea who she was, and that in fact she had specially pickedhim out because she was furious at her husband (it turned out sheactually liked Devereaux, so she was sorry about it, but damagedone).  The fleet is not particularly puritan, and everything wasconsensual and out of the chain of command, so Arch was cleared,officially.  Unofficially, his name was mud, especially with Academygraduates.The outbreak of war, and his ongoing success in battle, along withthe turnover of war-revealed dead-wood in the Admiralty ranks seemto have Devereaux's star on the rise again, but somehow he keepsgetting assigned to diplomatic missions which always end in bloodand disorder for some (as yet mysterious) reason.These are very straight-forward, low-key \"He did this, and then hedid that\" books which work better in that presentation than youmight think.  The battles are low-key as well.  Ships are veryexpensive and it is uncommon to have more than three on each sideengaging.  Space is also large, so there is a lot of hunt & seekwith weeks between engagements, and people are people, so there isalways backbiting and corruption in high places.  There is also onewoman who keeps turning up in all of Arch's troubles (sometimesseemingly as the cause of them), and she may be The One, though,as I said, it's a pretty casual setting, and Arch manages to findother friendly companionship (with benefits) along the way.",

        "reviewDescription": "But the space navy battles lack some essential details. There’s never any issues with detecting enemy ships. In fact there’s no mention of how ships are detected at all. There’s no real question of communications, or emissions control. Drones can explode on or near ships. Why aren’t the drones carrying nuclear warheads? Why aren’t they using nuclear bomb pumped laser fire?Everyone has FTL communications nearly all the time. It seems to me that would allow headquarters to micromanage operations, just as happens in our reality.Why did the fleet merger conference have about zero security? As soon as the details were revealed, I thought, “Ut oh, there’s trouble.”Computer security in the book is not as good as it was in the 1960s in the US. It seems like bad actors can do as they wish to computer systems without any problems.For a better example of the genre, read Chain of Command, by Frank Chadwick.",

Somehow, though, the author ties it all together in an entertaining way.  There are political machinations, espionage events and an occasional romance sometimes with an inappropriate participant.  You'll see what I mean if you read the book.  Highly recommended.",

        "reviewDescription": "My favorite book in the Horus Heresy series is Ben Counter's \"Galaxy in Flames.\" The reason being that it gripped me and moved me. More often than not I have had a hard time identifying with the space marines. They seemed too god-like, too cold; just heart-less killing machines. Counter made me care about the marines.James Swallow's book \"Flight of the Eisenstein\" follows Counter's book and moves the plot forward. In many respects I found Swallow's book equal too and sometimes superior (a hard call)to \"Galaxy in Flames.\"Some of the characters from the previous book re-appear and we see events from the earlier books played out from the point-of-view of members of the Death Guard.The protagonist of \"Flight of Eisenstein is Battle-Captain of the 7th Company of the Death Guard--Nathaniel Garro. For the most part, we see the action through his pov, although Swallow breaks the unity from time to time to enter the minds of subordinate characters.The book begins with an attack on a Jorgall ship, where we see both the Death Guard and the Oblivion Knight, Amendera Kendel, in action. A psyker's warning of impending doom alerts the reader to treachery ahead and the action begins.The \"Flight of the Eisenstein\" shows us Horus's strategy becoming visible in the battles of the Isstvan sector. It also develops the rise of the new saint Euphrati Keeler.These plot points are important to the overall development of the series; however, Swallow has presented some interesting touches. The description of the ship's trip through the warp seemed particularly clear and cogent; the hatred of Grulgor was palpable and handled well;the infestation and contamination of Decius was logical and well-developed; the description of the Luna base was brilliant; and the conversion of Garro was believable.In summary, Swallow writes a clear serviceable prose that moves the story along. His fantastic descriptions are quite realistic. I found it a very satisfying novel.",

        "reviewDescription": "James Swallow takes up the fourth novel of the Horus Heresy series, which follows one of the pivotal historical events of Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 universe. This novel tells the tale of Battle-Captain Nathaniel Garro of the Death Guard, a minor character in the previous books, and at its core this is a tale of his personal growth and discovery, though action features heavily as well. He is cut of the same cloth as Captain Garviel of the Sons of Horus Legion and main protagonist from the first novels: able, principled, and introspective. Several Primarchs and historical characters make appearances, including: Horus, Rogal Dorn, Mortarion, Captain Typhon (Death Guard), Captain Tarvitz (Emperor's Children), Captain Sigismund (Imperial Fists), and others.I have been a vocal critic of M. Swallow's past works for the Black Library, which have been long on purple prose and dues ex machina, and short on background knowledge and plot, so I picked up this book with no small amount of trepidation. However, I must say that this is easily his best work and is a worthy successor to the other Horus Heresy books.The characters have depth, realistic motivations and reactions, and grow in ways that make sense. Particularly telling is Garro's development as he attempts to come to terms with the betrayal of his own Primarch and that of Horus. Without going into anything that would spoil the plot for others, let's just say that it's well doneThe action scenes flow well, and convey an excellent sense of urgency. The opponents don't make stupid mistakes for the sake of the plot - a weakness in M. Swallow's prior works. His descriptions of the Primarchs, particularly Mortarion, feel slightly mundane once or twice, but typically have the proper sense of awe. The ending of the book gives a tantalizing hint of things to come without being a tease.In short: a solid addition to the Horus Heresy series and a good read that you'll have trouble putting down.",

        "reviewDescription": "What a pleasant surprise guys :OI must admit that I had no expectation regarding that book before reading. I had only been hearing miscellaneous reviews here and there : epic, dull, interesting, unnecessary.But my opinion is clear on the matter : the Flight of the Eisenstein is undeniably a high quality book. Admittedly, it's not as epic as the First Heretic, Betrayer or Horus Rising but it's almost every bit as good as them !James Swallow manages to steer the story in a very compelling way.We discover the great character named Nathaniel Garro. The only beacon of hope who can bring the news of Horus' betrayal to Terra.And most importantly, we learn to like him and to root for him.This book contains so much lore about the Death Guard legion : its customs, its ways, its fighting style, why the legionaries drink poison for breakfast, the internecine oppositions and their fall to chaos.In the face of sheer madness, appalling damnation and certain death stands Garro. Unyielding. Proud. Staunch. Loyal to his oath to mankind.The flight through the void is harsh, costly and exhausting but the reading is highly enjoyable and it will keep you hooked until the very last page !A legion falls, heroes rise and Primarchs get ready for an all-out conflict.If you wish to know more about the early stage of the Heresy then go get a copy of that book !Best regards guys :)",

    "bookDescription": "When the aliens evolve, so does the threat against humanity in this thrilling sequel to Scorpio that finds Alex Archer in an epic battle of survival against the odds and the alien invaders.\nAlex Archer is a soldier now, the only civilian survivor from Scorpio to join the NAC Defense Corps. With their training complete, Alex and her friend Private Isa Cressey find themselves on emergency combat deployment with their new unit. The destination is the Alpha Corvi system, where an allied warship has vanished. Alex can guess why.\nHer fears prove true—Alpha Corvi is under new ownership. Alex must face the monsters from her childhood again as her regiment mounts a rescue operation to find and save the planet’s colonists. But this time, there is something terrifyingly different about their enemy. The Corps has evolved to meet the threat, but the Lankies have adapted as well—and they are more lethal than ever. What began as a rescue turns into a desperate fight for survival for Alex and her new friends, stranded on a hostile world forty-nine light-years from Earth. And the only way home goes right through the Lankies.",

The story is not stretched way too much as it happens with some contemporary SF books and the end is not an absurd cliffhanger to let the readers waiting for the next installment. It is basically auto-conclusive thouhg it lets the things rather open and in a good sense. All in all, this is perhaps one of the best books in the saga and it points to fresh developments that fit with the previous ones.Just one or two tiny details that rubbed me wrong. For instance, Alex keeps on calling \"sir\" to every sargent and NCO she founds and no one of them chews her out for that. And burbers and PRC do not mix but in the first books of the series they mixed basically OK...",

When a Special Orbital Assault Regiment School nestled inside an asteroid belt suddenly goes dark, Mack and his team of Wreck Jumpers are tasked with putting eyes on the target.\nTheir mission: recon the site and turn the comms back on.\nWhat they find is a base in chaos with survivors desperately holding out for rescue amid oceans of floating rock and an unknown enemy determined to make the Wreck Jumpers part of a growing body count.\nJust one wrong move could mean a crushing end in the cold vacuum of space and the death of everyone relying on Mack and his operators…\nBut that's why Mack became a Wreck Jumper in the first place.",

        "reviewTitle": "This is not your normal scifi...  this is Wreck Jumpers.... modeled after Para rescue.",
        "reviewDescription": "Wreck Jumpers.If you pick this up and have no idea of the Galaxy Edge universe, this is a great teaser to get ALL of them.  This book was modeled after some of the most unsung heroes who do not want the accolades, who do not want the fame.  ParaRescue(PR). Most military knows now that Doc, is ..DOC.  Doc must be protected at all costs, however, PR's bring a whole new level of kick ass to the field.  When the US Special Forces calls for medivac, PR comes in and kicks more ass than the SF kids, to get the wounded out and safe.Why is this important?  Why do I put an emphasis on this level of effort?  Ask a military friend you know.  PR are the guys who JUMP INTO the areas that are so hot the SF teams need an evac, they are the fearless, only GOD will stop them from succeeding at whatever mission is in front of them.  Black holes?  bah, trivial crap.  The enlisted are the key drivers of the REC-teams.  You want something done?  Give it to the First Sargent and tell him the teams can have the rest of the day off when finished.  You won't get the order completed before it's done. There is a constant in any military, the Senior Enlisted are the backbone, and the officers, if they are smart will listen to them.  Remember that as you read forward.I thought this would be a \"Oh? crap broke? let's go get it and save folks and do some heroic stuff\" type of read, maybe in the first few paragraphs but it takes that and expands it into the Galaxy Edge universe, it shows the growth and mentoring of the enlisted characters in intense situations and allows you to put a real voice into your head when you read the lines.  There is the new guy who has to earn his place and keep it, the old salt running the team, who feels like he has a PhD in warfighting. and the Officers, who have all built something that this type of team must have.  Implicit trust in the team, each other, and doing the right thing, even if it will cause problems.Standard military, cover your ass is one thing, but in this Universe it carries to a whole new level.I apply voices to each character as I read, a voice, an image and a manner of body language.  Fresher, the new guy has this just out of puberty voice in my head that still breaks when he gets excited.  Top (Mack) has a voice similar to a 80's Scifi TV show Admiral, and Creeper?  His voice is one of the pilots off that same series.  yeah, corny as hell but.. it's how I read.The story is enveloping, enticing and absolutely spot on for this Universe and fits into it like a glove.  For those of you reading this, and not familiar, it is a perfect intro to the Universe and a great lead into Dark Ops, Night Ops and the skills and absolute top tier abilities to go save those and prevent the enemy access to the good stuff.  If you enjoy Scifi, this is a Universe that Jason and Nick and many others over at Wargate spend all their time giving us the ability to escape from the day to day BS we deal with.If you have read into this Universe, gear up, get your get set and your L-comm set for a few hours of seamless matching and some hair raising rescues and plots.This book has some really awesome plot slides and twists, and will keep you in it  cover to cover.  Get into Wreck Jumpers and get to reading.",

The spinoff series are definitely worth reading and the authors get to focus on what the teams instead of the larger universe. This is definitely one of the better leej books out there.

This one ran a little long in parts but the action and battles are in some new and unique settings. I'm looking forward to the next one. KTF.",

The humour is with us from the start, seen through the self-deprecating MC, and the world building comes natural through dialogue and action (no info dumps). The book feels like the first one in a series, limning the cast who I hope we’ll meet further down the page. I feel it deals with trauma in a somewhat cursory way, solving it logically, but not emotionally. And mind you, if you like to think out the solutions in the story (like in a murder mystery), this book isn’t about that. The solutions they come up with are part of the world building so you can’t know beforehand (but the solutions are plausible and rhymes with our world, so they are easy to buy, except for one time when it felt out of character, but that might explained when I read further).That said, it’s well worth spending your time with if you want fast paced action seen through a wry perspective.",

        "reviewDescription": "This is the first book I've read by Skyler Ramirez and I'm glad I found his work.  This first book was a refreshing read, light and funny and a fun adventure.  My only con first: it's short.  Weighing in at 137 pages, the first book is over quickly after the characters and world are established.  When I realized I was a third of the way through the book and I was still getting up to speed with the beginning of the main plot, I almost put it down.  But then I saw it was a series.  And that leads into the pros: It's an interesting world with interesting characters.  Brad Mendoza is a lovable self-destructive buffoon, with a past he hasn’t come to terms with.  He’s funny and self-depreciating, and the running narrative from his jaded perspective keeps the story moving.  Jessica Lin comes off as a two dimensional Miss Perfect but I think the coming books will flesh out her character more.  She’s got a past too, that will need to come to light.  There’s just the right amount of world-building for a book this length and I can’t wait to see what the rest of the series looks like.  And I’m hoping the antagonist from the first book ends up being the villain of the series.  We’ll see.  I highly recommend this if you’re looking for a light, clean, funny space adventure.",

        "reviewDescription": "Fun quick space opera read. Light humorous reading with basic characterization with implications of going deeper in future books. There was part that implied deeper into the ugly side of life and I was just as glad the author did not dwell on that. Adventure and action in this book and I expect in the books to come. I went ahead and ordered the rest of series that has been written so far and published in paperback.  I have since read several more of the series books.  They live up to the fun quality of this first book of the series.",

        "reviewTitle": "Where’s the Sixth Star for Awesomeness!",
        "reviewDescription": "I happened upon this book somewhat by accident.  As a new author in the genre I made it a point to familiarize myself with other books like what I was writing. It checked the boxes of social proof with a high number of reviews and the blurb was intriguing. What I didn’t expect was a wildly entertaining ride through the galaxy with Brad and Jessica, all orchestrated by Maestro Ramirez!The writing is great, the action is fast paced, but best of all, the humanity of the characters is what really shines through!  Skyler Ramirez’s style is not what one typically expects in many genres nowadays: he proves that an author can write without any gratuitous language and violence, but yet keeps it real. It’s refreshing, actually.I’m writing this review as I read through the 8th of this series since I got so into them I forgot to pay it forward to highly endorse this series!  It’s not just this series too, so read everything else Skyler has written.  Don’t be like Brad and go READ!",

        "reviewDescription": "I wasn't sure about this book at first, just from the blurb and details on Amazon, I tend to avoid the smaller books and go for longer ones that have some world building. But I gave this a chance, and I was immediately hooked, very short read, there's enough depth to the characters to get a sense on things and then it takes you on a whirlwind of an adventure. The story keeps building in the next book, and the one after (just starting the 4th now).I've not been able to put them down, enjoying the story, the flow, and the characters. Very entertaining reads that aren't over the top so it ends up being relaxing to read. Would highly recommend!",

        "reviewDescription": "I've been an avid reader my entire adult life, since the 70s. In this day of self-publishing, there's a lot of bad writing out there now that in the past never would have made it to the press. A reader often has to wade through a lot of badly written slop before finding someone who can actually write well. So I'm very happy to have recently discovered Mr. Ramirez. He knows how to write and he delivers on the promise of his titles. It's light-hearted escapism, and very, very funny. And his writing skill is excellent, a pleasure to read. I will be reading the rest of the series.",

        "reviewDescription": "The second book of the Horus Heresy series, this time penned by Graham McNeill, is a ripping adventure tale that continues the story of Horus' inevitable fall. Garviel Lorken, the Company Captain of the Sons of Horus Legion and main protagonist from the first novel, now shares the stage with Horus himself in roughly equal measure. The supporting cast is too numerous to list here, but suffice to say, it includes many other canonical characters from Games Workshop's Warhammer 40K universe: Horus, Angron, Fulgrim, Magnus, Kharn, Abaddon, Fabius, and others.M. McNeill does an excellent job capturing the feel of the 40K background, excels at action scenes, and captures the epic scope of the Crusade and subsequent Heresy. You really feel the ground tremor as titans stride into battle, and quail before Angron's savagery as he charges into the fray. The enemies of the Imperium fight intelligent campaigns that reflect well thought out strategy, making them worthy foes.Gone, however, is the subtlety and delicate moral quandary of M. Abnett. Lorken's character growth, and that of some of the other characters, takes a back seat to Horus' tale and larger-scale conflict. This brings me to the two weaker points of the novel:1 - M. McNeill uses some clumsy plot devices at key points in the work. The Mournival (Horus' council of Captains) and some of the senior Sons of Horus act stupidly or ignorantly from time to time, even though it's been firmly established that they are neither. There are a few other instances where Marines \"regress\" from extremely wily to easily misled.2 - The biggest difficulty, however, is in the representation of the change in Horus. There are no slippery moral slopes filled with the excuses of expediency or necessity. There is no gradual or subtle descent, such as those displayed by M. Abnett's Inquisitor Eisenhorn. Instead, Horus takes the Warp induced visions of a man he admittedly doesn't even trust, and makes a decision without even checking the veracity of these mirages. As it's really one of the pivotal moments of the entire epic, it's disappointing that it doesn't receive the attention it deserves.These - although fairly significant - detractors aside, the book is a very engaging read, and M. McNeill's writing style holds the reader's attention throughout. The plot flows well, and one can't wait to begin the next chapter after finishing the previous.In short: a generally solid work with a few troubles for more discerning readers. However, any fan of 40K will easily get his money's worth on this ride.",

        "reviewDescription": "Like watching film of 9-11, or the attack on Pearl Harbor, or the start of World War I.  A haunting sense of imminent tragedy that we can see coming but cannot  avert.To be honest, before I read this book and Horus Rising I was not really looking forward to reading the Horus Heresy novels.  I thought I already knew the story, the characters would be flat caricatures, and much of the action would be like something out of a well-funded but completely derivative comic-book movie.  I have come to expect great things from Dan Abnett and Graham McNeill, but I feared that even writers with their talent would be hard-pressed to make such a formula work.I am very happy to report that I could not have been more wrong.  The plot is epic, in a quite literal sense; the rich and mysterious tapestry forming the backdrop for the action - the descriptions of the physical environments and the social, historical, and even mythological contexts in which the plot unfolds — is mesmerizing, horrifying, and heartbreaking all at once; and the central characters - Loken, Torgaddon, Karkasy [sp?], and Keeler in particular - are well-drawn and tremendously sympathetic.  If you enjoyed the Eisenhorn, Ravenor, and Gaunt’s Ghosts series, you will love this book.",

Terra burns as reality itself unravels and the greatest bastion of civilisation teeters on the brink of annihilation. Desperate defenders gather, banding against the rabid traitor hordes. The Hollow Mountain, host to the pilgrims of Euphrati Keeler, is one of the last redoubts, held by the Dark Angels while the unclean host of Typhus lays siege. Malcador the Sigillite sits ablaze on the Golden Throne, trying to buy his master more time. But time is running out… Guilliman races across the stars to reinforce the Throneworld. Will he return to ashes, where a Warmaster of Chaos has ascended to godhood, or will the Emperor have triumphed? And at what cost? It all comes down to one final, climactic confrontation: the Emperor versus Horus. The father against the son.",

        "reviewTitle": "a satisfying conclusion",
        "reviewDescription": "While some might take issue with the lack of quantifiable feats and abilities from the Emperor and the general plot itself, I felt that the atmosphere was a fitting conclusion to an apocalyptic battle that has been built up towards over 17 years and dozens of moves and novellas. As a fan of 40k there will be things that frustrate you. The lore nerds in you will cry out. But at the end, it felt appropriate. The nightmare is over, and the dream will never be reclaimed, but it can be fought for. A new hell approaches inevitably, ten thousand years of terrible struggle and degradation as the faint concept of good becomes ever more elusive. But, in this day, here and now, the horror has subsided. An era has ended. Go into this with an open mind is what I advise, try and seek closure instead of hoping for something that will fit every preconception you have, and it will feel like what it should be.The end and the death.",

        "reviewDescription": "There's a longstanding critique of another SF author, Greg Egan, who writes science fiction with actual science in it (never happens in 40k), where his novels are basically little palimpsets to set his scientific stuff upon, and his characters are limp and flat.I think there's some of this going on in this book, where the sheer literal _number_ of the characters means that the Primarchs and like, Loken and stuff are the only ones that keep their integrity in this gigantic oceanic mass of the overarching strength of the setting. Characters are little figurines to hang the grand gothicness of the setting on. Literal hundreds of characters, they can't get equal screen time - obviously the fight between Horus and the Emperor is central stage, but lots of the rest is forgettable.Otherwise, it's a good book. I enjoy the Emperor remaining mysterious to the end, despite doing a lot of shonen anime stuff.",

The outcome of the war lies on a knife edge. The Warmaster Horus’ bloody seven-year crusade has led to this – the cradle of humanity, where he is to kill his father, the Emperor.\nWith the war at this critical juncture, Sanguinius, primarch of the loyalist Blood Angels, braves the horrors of the Warmaster’s flagship, The Vengeful Spirit, with a single purpose in mind – to slay his brother Horus, decapitate the Heresy once and for all, and stop the forces of Chaos from taking Terra.\nBut at the whim of a Warmaster fallen so far from grace, the Dark Gods will not make Sanguinius’ task easy. As the war edges towards its explosive, bloody conclusion, events are about to unfold that could either save humanity or plunge it headlong into an eternity of darkness.",

        "reviewDescription": "Dan Abnett's work surprises, delights, terrifies, glorifies, horrifies, humbles, enlightens and confuses through metahphysical, allegorical and material/immaterial odyssey. The siege becomes a siege on the very concept of humanity, our very best and worst natures laid bare. A work that is the culmination of many hands and many ideas should feel consequential, and Siege doesn't disappoint and The End and the Death trilogy stands above it's worthy peers in the series. I wouldn't start reading unless you have a very free day, because you'll find the work enthralling and lose sense of time (perhaps a metaphysical spillover of un-time from the work in question?).",

        "reviewTitle": "Pares down the fluff from the 1st book and presses the peddle to the metal!",
        "reviewDescription": "Disregard that 1 star review from some whiner complaining and spoiling the novel for everyone else. It was written by someone who already decided beforehand that he hated this book. Just another 40k edgelord who can only complain about what *he* doesn't like and tries to ruin the game/lore/hobby for everyone else. We all know this type... he's a \"that guy\".Let's break it down, *without spoilers* as that's the appropriate approach. Obviously I'm going to take for granted that everyone knows that the Emperor is mortally wounded and the loyalists win a pyrrhic victory against Horus and Chaos. This battle is how the entire setting for the 40k universe is brought about. It's no secret. What these books (and all of the Horus Heresy novels) are doing is giving us incredible detail as to how exactly the 40k universe becomes what it is.Ok, that said, the first half of this book is *much* more about the supporting cast of characters than the 1st book. Malchador and the Emperor feature far less (though the Emperor does show up near the end for an epic, and sad, reveal) and with Malchador being almost entirely consumed by the Golden Throne his chapters are often nothing more than short, broken thoughts. More time is given to characters like Fo & Amon, John, Oll and the Companions, Rann, Azkaellon and the Astartes who were trapped outside after the Eternity Gate closed, Amit and the \"Denial Companies\" set up to defend the inner sanctum, Dorn who continues to try and figure out a way to get free from Khorne's trap, and finally Sanguinius in all his glory. Lastly, for brief chapters (all the chapters are extremely brief... maybe 10 pages at most, most are only 2 - 4 pages), the Emperor, Valdor and the few remaining Custodes. Valdor is perhaps the one with the least amount of \"screen time\", showing up for a couple chapters early on and then never brought up again. There's a decent amount of time given to the Emperor in the first quarter, then nothing for a long portion, only to show up near the end for some *really* important moments. Perhaps some of the most important moments in the entire storyline, outside of Sanguinius death and the final clash between Him and Horus.The first half can generally be split into 3 sections; outside the Palace, inside the Palace and the Vengeful Spirit. There's one aspect of this book that permeates every part and it's actually really wonderfully done, and that is the warp's complete breakdown of spacetime and geometry. The outside and inside of the palace quickly becomes meaningless... it's both and neither at the same time but I'm sticking to the inside & outside designation to just make it easy. It started to happen during the 1st book but it *really* takes off in this one. *Nobody* is where they intend to be, not even the traitors. It can be subtle, like a winding staircase becoming counter-clockwise when it should have been clockwise, or entire structures (like a certain infamous prison) simply appearing dozens of kilometers away from where they should be. Characters frequently walk through one door only to appear impossibly far away from where they should be, sometimes not even on Terra any more. Even the inner sanctum is succumbing to the warp, making the nigh-unshakable Custodes feel unnerved (well, as close to unnerved as they can get).One thing is definitely certain though; the end of all things is imminent. Vulcan is even counseled to enact the \"Seven Hammers\" protocol, which will destroy the Golden Throne and all of Terra. The Dark King finally manifests itself, throwing everyone who looks upon it (on one side at least) into pure fright, yes even Astartes, and madness as they flee from it. Erebus shows up, chasing after John & his companions and really puts a hurt on the group. Abaddon very nearly kills him and I really wish he did. Erebus is just the absolute worst. Luckily for the loyalists, and once again thanks to the warp, time has stopped as well (which really pisses off the Dark Mechanicus as all of their machines start to fail). The first quarter of the book really dives in and drives home that nothing is proper and nothing can be trusted. Not senses, not direction, nothing. Orders are relayed on scribbled paper and run between units like a WW1 trench runner (but on jet bikes), dataslates and vox commo are long abandoned. *Nobody* is in communication with anyone from the Anabasis boarding party on the Vengeful Spirit *except* one could maybe make the argument for the 9th legion Astartes who constantly \"dream\" in their battle-weary fugue states of Sanguinius as he progresses through the ship in low orbit (obviously this tenuous, dream-like connection will be *VERY* important later on).Speaking of Sangunius, the 1st half deals with him and his personal guard fighting through the ranks of traitors to reach Horus. After that grueling battle, he is cut off from his guard and \"lost\" in darkness. Eventually *someone* shows up (not gonna say who) and helps guide Sanguinius out of the darkness and eventually to Horus. The final battle between Horus and Sanguinius is... well, it felt underwhelming to me. This is another instance where the outcome is no secret. Horus kills Sanguinius and while yes, it's sad, it's not as moving as I expected it to be. Maybe my own hype for this moment was built up too much (I mean, their battle is literally on the cover so I feel like *everyone* was hyped for this moment) but it didn't land like I expected it to. It's still wonderfully written and Abnett even made me think for a moment, \"Wait, is Sanguinius going to win this fight?\" even though it's already been well documented for many decades now that he doesn't. It was a joy to read Sanguinius actually start to piss Horus off and truly hurt him too, but we all know how it end and it ends... fast. Once Horus is able to actually catch him, he lands (basically) two blows and that's all he wrote. The first one cripples Sanguinius, the second kills him. I wanted it to be more emotional for me than it really was. Honestly, the reveal of the Dark King, the conversation (it) has with a certain character and the realization of what (it's) doing and what will happen because of (it's) decision, was more impactful for me than the fight between Horus and Sanguinius.The book suffers from the same issues the 1st one did, though not as bad, which is Abnett's *extreme* verbosity. I swear, I had to look up more words in the dictionary than I could count. Many are able to be interpreted from the way they're used in a sentence but combined with the totally made up words, about 100+ pages could be cut from the book just by exercising the fluff Abnett likes to throw in. It's not nearly as bad as the 1st book, which had literally back to back pages and pages of just made-up locations, characters and their titles who played no role beyond simply being names & titles. I won't say these books are his \"best\" work (I'm reserving judgement until all 3 are released and read), it's definitely his *grandest*. You can tell he put so much love and care into crafting these novels, which makes sense as these are the penultimate Horus Heresy storylines, and the fact that he wrote the first book some 2 decades ago that kicked this all off. Maybe a bit *too much* love and care, but if that's a fault...I'm also not sure how I feel about the liberal use of borrowed phrases from famous literary pieces with no reference to their origin. It feels... dishonest. \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" a line by T.S. Eliot for example, is used with zero reference to where it came from. Just tossed in as a line Khorne uses to taunt Dorn. This \"borrowing\" has been done throughout the Horus Heresy novels so you could give it a pass but I've never liked when they do this. Almost every novel (that I've read) contains lines like these. At other times, certain lines come across like when a movie character says the name of the movie. A character in the book says \"the grim darkness of the far future\" which is the well known tag line for 40k. A bit too tongue in cheek for the absolutely horrible events unfolding in this book and it just immediately makes me think of that Family Guy episode where they point and laugh at this trope. These moments are jarring and only serve to take me out of the story when I come across them.The good thing about this book is it's much more pared down than the 1st book. Gone are the truly massive amounts of filler. It's still a long book (650+ pages) but it reads VERY fast. With each chapter averaging 3 or 4 pages long, you really fly through it. Abnett has also cut down on the fluff words, creating a more direct and precise read, despite the mind-jarring twisting and dislocation every character experiences. If the 1st book sets up the premise and layout for every character, then this book is the streamlined version, stepping on the gas. Looking forward to the 3rd and final book to come out so we can really take them all in as one story. The end is truly really here, with the greatest story of the 40k universe only one book away from reaching its conclusion (Don't fret! There's still \"The Scouring\" plotlines to explore afterwards and A LOT happens during that. The Fallen, the 2nd Founding and the Codex Astartes, what happened to all of the remaining loyalist Primachs, the traitor forces fleeing into the Eye of Terror/the Maelstrom... tales of revenge, violence and loss so epic as they sweep out across the entire galaxy! It's when 40k *really* becomes \"modern\" 40k).",

The siege is almost over, the enemy has breached the walls and the defenders are fighting for their lives as enemies come from all sides. I'm trying to stay vague, as I don't want to spoil the book, but this one is a great read. Everything is coming to a head and everyone has lost control. No one is sure how or when it happened, but any semblance of military order is gone on both sides. Men brawl by firelight with hooks and clubs, but they can't remember even what they are fighting for anymore. A fifth great power of chaos is ready to be born, and its birth scream will be the end and the death of the human race.",

Sanguinius, Dorn, Vulkan, Corswain, Amit, Sartak, Honfler, Agathae, Keller, quantos personagens bons. Bora finalizar e seguir pro terceiro.",

It was a fantastic start, every page of it was it worth...Now, more than fifty books later,  look what we have: of the 600 pages of the book, only 100, perhaps, are worth of it... The other five hundred are just for filling the book with plots uninteresting  and absurdly repetitive (with other books in the series) and sell it a as full book..Games workshop cant receive any credit or applause for such a way to destroy an excelent storyline.. Just for the sake of money. My congrats for selling your souls to the warp and finishing the Horus heresy  in such a shameful way.",

I would simply say that the Emperor lost, and the religious fanatics won, but now that Guilliman has been resurrected, reason and superstition are at war in the galaxy once again, and even the Primarch might be no match against the power of faith and fanaticism.And that's just one storyline (though, in my view, it's the most interesting and important one) in this novel. The main plot is ostensibly about Mortarian and his host of plague of demons continuing their assault on Ultramar, and the forces of the loyal primarch Guilliman doing battle against him, with reasonably exciting results. Other storylines include that of a newly assigned Novamarine of the Primaris type who is not fitting in with adopted culture of his new chapter and, my least favorite, a side plot concerning the battle between Imperial and Plague-tainted titans.But this book gets five stars for me since it is the most thoughtful, funny and tragic exploration of the Emperor's failure to spread reason and to vanquish superstition, since the Horus Heresy books. And Guilliman gains additional complexity here, after being too often portrayed as an idealistic Boy Scout.",

    "bookDescription": "2018 Locus Award, Best Science Fiction Novel\nOur universe is ruled by physics, and faster-than-light travel is not possible - until the discovery of The Flow, an extradimensional field we can access at certain points in space-time that transports us to other worlds, around other stars.\nHumanity flows away from Earth, into space, and in time forgets our home world and creates a new empire, the Interdependency, whose ethos requires that no one human outpost can survive without the others. It's a hedge against interstellar war - and a system of control for the rulers of the empire.\nThe Flow is eternal - but it is not static. Just as a river changes course, The Flow changes as well, cutting off worlds from the rest of humanity. When it's discovered that The Flow is moving, possibly cutting off all human worlds from faster-than-light travel forever, three individuals - a scientist, a starship captain, and the empress of the Interdependency - are in a race against time to discover what, if anything, can be salvaged from an interstellar empire on the brink of collapse.",

        "reviewTitle": "One of my favorite sci fi books in years",
        "reviewDescription": "\"The humans malfunctioned long before their habitat did.\"The edges and boundaries of human experience and the possibilities beyond them are the things I like best in my science fiction. I found these in spades within The Collapsing Empire, along with humor alternately dry and caustic, characters I loved and loathed, and questions both alarming and intriguing.The Collapsing Empire is the first in a series called The Interdependency - the second, titled The Consuming Fire, is due out in October of 2018. It's a space opera set in a new universe, ostensibly hundreds of years into our future. Humanity has spread itself all over the galaxy, constrained by the exit points of the mysterious Flow through which spaceships can travel at speeds unheard-of in standard physics. Now, the Flow has begun to collapse - and we're told the Interdependency will soon follow.The story is told through the eyes of three characters - Kiva, Cardenia, and Marce. I found Marce a little forgetable, but that's primarily because Kiva - ruthless daughter of a merchant house - is so delightfully brash, and Cardenia, being the new Emperox of the Interdependency, is in much more interesting surroundings. Marce is hardly ignorable, though, as his father's research could be the key to anyone understanding the Flow's situation in time to act.As with all of Scalzi's novels, the writing is snappy and dialogue-heavy. When combined with the gripping story, this makes for a very fast read - so fast, in fact, that Scalzi had to write a blog post ensuring fans that it wasn't any shorter than average. It also makes for a fun audiobook, narrated by Wil Wheaton.As I mentioned, I especially loved Kiva. She has a strident love for vehement swearing, but that's far from her only avenue of profanity - she is also frankly and openly sexual, appraising current conversation partners as near future sex partners frequently and regardless of gender. The book treats same sex relationships and dalliances with a refreshingly casual attitude. Further, this is the first book I've read that considered same sex relationships as a viable option for political marriage! (Gideon's Riders does this too, but I read The Collapsing Empire first. I am now spoiled and will never accept a lack of full consideration again!)The science fiction I've liked best has always used a scientific conceit to ask a question about humanity. In The Collapsing Empire, the conceit is \"what if faster-than-light travel wasn't even necessary?\" The relevant technobabble is tongue-in-cheek, smoothing over the problem of faster-than-light travel by introducing the Flow, and then glossing over the Flow itself as too complex for proper explanation:\"This was, of course, an absurd way of looking at the Flow. The Flow is not anything close to a river—it is a multidimensional brane-like metacosmological structure that intersects with local time-space in a topographically complex manner, influenced partially and chaotically but not primarily by gravity, in which the ships accessing it don’t move in any traditional sense but merely take advantage of...\"...and so on. Despite the brevity and intentional vagueness, the Flow is a novel way to surmount the issue, and serves its narrative function neatly.The question this book asks is what will happen when the politics of the few get in the way of the needs of the species...which is an all too topical question. Our own current political climate is in a maddeningly similar situation, and the comparison to the book is neither favorable nor hopeful, for me.Real-world analogs aside, the story is definitely its own entity, not a direct allegory for reality. Humanity has spread itself out along spindly connections, and then staked its chances of continued survival heavily on these connections. The Interdependency is built on heavily intertwined economic, religious, and governmental systems, each of which are interested primarily in ensuring their own survival, rather than the survival of the species. The three character perspectives through which we experience the events are a neat mirror for this triumvirate - each character is interested in preserving themselves and something beyond their own skin. (I won't go so far as to say the characters each represent one of the systems of power...yet. I might be convinced of this in future books.)This is one of my favorite science fiction books I've read in recent years, and I can't wait to read more.",

        "reviewDescription": "I wanted to give this 5 stars... I just couldn't.  John is a very good author.  No doubt about that.  I like the book and the premise.  He weaves the tale together like a fine tapestry.  Political machinations, intrigue, some hard science fiction and a boatload of characters.  The most important statement and plot element may slip by most readers but he nails it and for that a tip of my hat.Definitely a fun read and it flew by because he doesn’t overburden his writing with long drawn out descriptions of every little detail.  Let’s face it, some authors spend 14 pages describing the weather around a scene.  A lot of us start flipping pages when it gets too deep.  John avoids that.I have a few issues with the book.  No spoilers here.  Most of this is mentioned in the marketing and look inside view on Amazon.One… he made a mistake by claiming that “Our universe is ruled by physics. Faster than light travel is impossible…”  He then immediately creates a universe where those very laws are violated by his plot.  Sorry John, you took the science high ground on FTL and then proceeded to create something far more preposterous.  There is solid physics behind the concept of ‘warp’ drive as used in Star Trek.  FTL will be possible… well, if the human race survives itself that is.Two… although the names of ships are fun, they are a bit ridiculous.  I also think he should have skipped reading Dune before he wrote this.  He got lost in naming the characters with names that are hard to follow, pronounce and don’t keep us clear on gender.  In a universe where earthlings are using all the language common for earthlings, he veers off and gives them names that make no cultural sense.  In Dune, the characters aren’t from earth so their language and culture would flow different directions.  John mixes earth and non-earth terms with abandon.Three… the extreme overuse of the F word by people who are educated, successful and upper class.  Aside from the fact it was getting old, it was just unnecessary.  I’ve been in biker bars where I heard the F word less.  Even on the streets of New York City, where the F word is used as punctuation, it didn't wear on me as much as in this book.Again, liked the concept, like John’s writing style.  Just think he bounced off of some things that should have been left in the editor’s trash can.  Honestly, I’m not sure I’ll read the rest of the series.  I’ve already read Dune more than once.",

And if you're new to Scalzi, you will simply be astounded by his fresh and breezy style and dialogue. Scalzi writes real grownups, people who have interesting motivations and appetites, and his universes are unapologetically diverse. Along with hilarious and sexy, in equal measure! I caught myself laughing out loud frequently, as characters made wry internal observations that were absolutely delightful. Scalzi's writing is fresh and his plotting is tight. Highly recommend.",

        "reviewDescription": "After reading so many of Scalzi books in the last few week this is the one that really puts him 'up there' with the sci fi greats of Asimov , Arthur Clarke, & Frank Herbert.a whole new concept of realism in sci fi, what if space travel took ages between planets?, theres no warp drive, faster than light drive.  What if the only way to even travel between far distance planets was to piggy back into a space flow which were \"one way streets\" and you needed a flow in either direction to 'go and come back'? Then what if these flows have existed for thousands of years and you base your whole empire and the future of humanity and your economy on this space travel and then find that these flows might not be as stable as you think? Thats the under laying concept of this book about battling companies wanting to feed their profits and wanting to control the whole of humanity. I have become a fan of Scalzi since Covid 19 created Lockdown and I have read a lot of his books in the last four months, I'm married to author Jean Fullerton and I know how hard she works on plots, research, characterisation and 'story lines', basically she says its an 8 hour a day job, so I get to see her when she 'clocks off'. Mr Scalzi judging from your output and the quality of your books and plots I dont think you can ever leave your desk: you must live the life of a hermit because your head must be so full of stories; you have written such a variety of works so your family can't ever see you because you must always be writing the next one. But thankyou to your family and to you because I have really enjoyed every thing youve written, and i still have many more to read. Its hard to find a new author who can deliver 'the goods' Scalzi is my go to guy for a damn good read;  I recommend this author to all sci fi fans.",

        "reviewDescription": "Mr Hystad is a brilliant and highly creative story teller. The writing is clear and consistent with the story arc he created 24 books ago. The reader will find themselves turning the pages in each book. That said, \"Old Habits\" reigns as one of the best, both for the series as well as compared with other 21st century sci-fi books. Remember: family first and we are Survivors.  Extraordinary read.Recommend starting with the first book \"The Event\" but each book is a story unto itself.",

    "bookDescription": "The final enemy has been revealed, and it's more insidious than Van could ever imagine, spanning space and time with the patience of immortality—and an utter disregard for all forms of life.\nOn the run and broken, the Equal Grasp faces elimination on earth and everywhere else, their leader gone, their mission a shambles, and with new agents of justice hard on their heels.\nBut the fight isn't over. In fact, it's just begun, and Van knows that every decision he's made for the past decade will come to bear on who lives, and who dies—and who is meant to rule over a universe where freedom and justice are the ultimate pursuit.\nAt any cost, Van and his crew will finish the job, but they're going to need a lot of help from people and beings who have been observers.\nUntil now.\nThe time for watching is over. The time for victory is now. But the cost might be more than anyone can pay, and Van is no longer merely an agent of justice. He's a father, a husband, and a friend—and he's going to need every connection in the stars to defeat the ultimate enemy and save his people.",

        "reviewDescription": "I love the characters in this book. They’re not just human and the aliens are all very unique.  All of them have very discerning personalities which just get better with each book. Above all, I love their banter, their humor, their witty one liners and arguments like sibling kids. The crew, with its family atmosphere, just continues to grow, thrive and surprise us with some of the most random things, like movie productions. There’s a lot going on in this crew’s life. They’re being pulled in many directions. The biggest threats being Calamity and the ever present traitorous Guild leaders and those who follow them—either,believing their bogus propaganda or they’re true believers in the abuse of power and are willing participants in that endeavor. The story seems to hop around a lot but that just cements the rather random chaos this crew and their Allie’s are fighting. A bold move at the end will either help them them or doom them.",

Especially when I got all caught up and had to wait for the next new book.And here I am, again, waiting for the next volume. Thanks ok, lots to read in the meantime!24 was pretty good. Lots of action, world building and interesting developments. My only complaint is that it took the entire book just to reach the ultimate step of what we knew was going to happen. And when i5 did it was an anti-climax. After all that happened Van and his band of merry sentients are not any closer to their actual goal.To end on a positive note I appreciate how Van is able to listen to his friends and let them help him make honorable, ethical decisions. It’s almost like a video game and we are given choices. All of which will advance the plot, but not all of which give the “A+” ending.I’m glad I picked this series up all those months ago.  Time well spent!Cheers!",

It's one of those things that compelled me from the very beginning to keep going. I found the characters very relatable and the dialog to be really fresh and fun, all in all a great read and I can't wait for book 2. :)PS- I saw a review talking about this book being AI-generated? Do not believe that at all, it is 100% inaccurate, there is nothing AI about any of this book, it's clear as day this was written by the authors.",

With his wife, former Special Forces warrior Jane Sagan, he farms several acres, adjudicates local disputes, and enjoys watching his adopted daughter grow up.\nThat is, until his and Jane's past reaches out to bring them back into the game — as leaders of a new human colony, to be peopled by settlers from all the major human worlds, for a deep political purpose that will put Perry and Sagan back in the thick of interstellar politics, betrayal, and war.\nThe highly anticipated conclusion to John Scalzi's SF trilogy begun with Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades concludes with The Last Colony",

I'd only be repeating that info here. What I want you to know is that Scalzi is a genius Writer (with a capital \"W\"). \"Writer\" seems so pedestrian when referring to Scalzi. Better to describe him as \"Novelist\" or \"Storyteller\" or \"Wordmonger\" (maybe not that last one). Or \"Craftsman.\" His stories are clever and brilliant, all unique, humorous and dramatic, believable...yet out there. If you want to get your mind off your troubles, or the troubles of the world, or you want to let go of your disbeliefs willingly (like a movie), or you need some frivolity, or you like plot twists and turns, or you think you can guess what's coming next or later in a story (like I do) but you get it totally wrong, or you just want a tale that blows your mind, read one of John Scalzi's books. I guarantee that you will be totally ecstatic, if not downright jubilant. You're welcome.",

        "reviewDescription": "The Last Colony is the third book in the series. If you haven't read the other two, Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades, then I urge you to get your hands on them and read them. The Ghost Brigades was probably my favorite of the series, but really, all of the books, including the novelette, The Sagan Diaries, are good and contribute to the overall story arc.As of this moment, I think this may be the weakest book of the three, but don't take that as a criticism. I often find it takes me a little while after reading a story to fully appreciate it. By writing this review right away I'm being unfair. I haven't had time to appreciate the subtleties.I'm amazed by how well Scalzi was able to surprise me with the story. Yet, he somehow, comfortingly, allowed me to predict a few things. I like that combination.The story progressed at a good pace, constantly keeping me entertained, unlike Excession, where I felt bogged down for days and weeks suffering through what seemed like mindless background to get to the good stuff. In the end Excession paid off, but I didn't have to wait until the ending twist for The Last Colony to pay off.*** Spoilers Below ***Even though I feel all glowy about the book, I do have a few complaints. I didn't feel much for the new characters. When Hiram Yoder is killed it should be a poignant scene, but it isn't. Yes, I feel a loss of someone important to the colony, but not to the story. Even Savitri, who is an interesting character to be sure, lacks the depth that gives me any feeling for her. Hickory and Dickory are the only new characters that I really felt a sense of attachment.I felt much more for the characters introduced in the other two novels: John, Jane, Jared, Harry, even Szilard and Boutin.I'm also a little disappointed that the werewolves disappeared after a critical scene. What happened between them and the colony? Was it possible to negotiate? I know it would have needlessly extended the book to go into those details, but I still wonder.Overall though, it's an excellent end to the series. Scalzi wrapped up the plot and the series in a happy ending without making it sappy or unbelievable. In the afterward he said he wouldn't be coming back to these characters. Although I'll miss them, I'm glad. As I get older my patience for long series grows short. Even though each book he's written so far can stand alone, I don't think I could stand another 10 year series.He hasn't left out the possibility of returning to the world again one day and I look forward to new stories from this world.",

        "reviewDescription": "The Last Colony is the third book in a (currently) six book series with a few novella's thrown in. If you haven't heard of them before, please start with Old Man's War, the first in the series as it's an ongoing story line and you won't understand a lot of what is going on without them.So with that disclaimer pout of the way!  I really enjoyed the first two books in the series and the third book, was equally engrossing. I sped through it in two days. If you liked the first two novels, you'll like this is the short version.To the slightly longer version! The Last colony focuses on The Old Man's War protagonist John Perry again. Thanks to the results of The Ghost Brigade he has managed to leave the military and settle down with his new wife Jane Sagan and their adopted daughter Zoe. Everything is peaceful despite the universe's conflicts but unfortunately that won't last as John, Jane and Zoe are hand picked to lead a new colony. It's a special circumstance and they need them as neutral leaders yet with military and administrative skills to deal with what's ahead. However the Colonial Defense Force aren't telling them everything and the situation is far worse then they realize....The thing I really like about the series so far is each book has been pretty different yet still obviously set in the same universe. It starts off a little slower than the previous books but I greatly enjoyed the more political and survivalist set up it builds and I think it ties up a lot of events pretty nicely overall. The characters are all still really great (I especially like Jane) and some interesting new ones are introduced. The writing style continues to be easy to read with great pacing so I never felt bored or confused about what was going on.Overall, another great book in the series. Recommended.+ Interesting story setting.+ Great characters.+ Easy to read with great pacing.",

        "reviewDescription": "This is the first book of a space-based Science Fiction series. As such, it gives some background and current-day events before getting into the 'meat' of the story.The story starts out focusing on Jace. He's a military combat veteran of the opposition forces to the current government. This led to him spending time in a government prison. Upon his release, his only viable option for employment is to work for a shadowy organization. The only reason he remains on his home planet and works for them is to assist his ailing mother and his retired combat veteran father. As the story unfolds, Jace is forced into making hard decisions that affect his future.As a reader, I love that the book had a touch of mystery and intrigue. I'm looking forward to reading the next books in the series.Disclaimer: I was invited, along with other readers, to read this book. I voluntarily agreed to do so. Above are my honest thoughts on this book.",

Update: thought I should clarify. Almost every sentence is separated by a blank line. In a few cases, a few sentences may form a paragraph, but most commonly every sentence is separated like a paragraph. Reading this is a bit like trying to read while traveling down a road full of potholes, you keep getting jarred and have to take a second to get back to where you were. A well written book should flow, word to word, sentence to sentence, and paragraph to paragraph leading the reading smoothly through the story. This book is the direct opposite of that.",

Since then I’ve purchased everything I can find of Mr Reed’s work & re-read most of them (at least once) along the way. Top Duck is no exception. My only complaint - I wanted more at the finish. Bear in mind each book in these series are interconnected and have cliffhangers. Good thing is that you never have to wait for long to get the next instalment. Not for anyone who can’t deal with some death and mayhem along the way. I’m eagerly awaiting Book 3 - what a great Christmas present.

Monkeys may be clever and too stubborn to give up, but Skippy The Idiot Who Got Played knows the harsh truth: this is a fight he can’t win. The odds are not only stacked against him, he was designed not to win this fight.\nMaybe he can salvage some faint memory of the civilizations that inhabit the galaxy, but those beings are doomed. Doomed. Including the Merry Band of Pirates.",

No surprise there.  We do that to each other.So, I'll leave it that these books are a good read.  Someone already mentioned the concluding sequences is great.  I agree.Great 15 books seriesSteve",

The ending, though, I just thought it was rushed a bit, with too many loose ends needing tied up in a hurry and an impossible outcome handwaved into existence.  I wish a little more effort would have gone into solving the problem in a realistic (for this series) way rather than blah blah blah oh crap we're all doomed wait nevermind Skippy just came up with some magic that's not going to be explained type situation.

        "reviewDescription": "If you are a fan of Joe and Skippy and the whole crowd of characters then I think you will like this book very much. It checks all the boxes, but never feels like it is checking boxes. It feels like a good tale, well told, that grew naturally. Plenty of humor, and the dialog is almost always just right. There is plenty of the usual bantering and sometimes bickering. I am trying to avoid spoilers, so no specifics. The Merry Band have their work cut out for them, and as usual they will have to \"punch above their weight\" as Simms puts it. Way above. Because, Elders coming and you should be terrified. So, it is kind of a swan song. Or not. Depending on how you read between the lines and whether you correctly guess which way the twists will go.I am in my sixties and have read literally thousands and thousands of SF books and almost as many short stories. This concluding novel is probably the best final installment I have ever read in SF and among the best of any kind of fiction I have read. Will most readers find some things make them unhappy? Of course. There is no such thing as perfection. Well, except for Skippy the Magnificent, duh. (Also, it is not much of a spoiler to reveal that everyone's favorite sketchy con artist Jeraptha, Captain Scorandum of the ECO is in the book. Along with everyone's favorite Jeraptha aide to Scorandum, Kinsta. Good times.)Yes, it is a long book, but it flies by. A page turner. Enjoy. I will not say, \"Trust the awesomeness\". Nobody's luck lasts forever, right? 😎😎😎😎😎",

I found the production to be a little corny in some places. RC Bray of course brings it home with his wonderful voice acting, also Kate Mulgrew was a treat to listen to and nailed her performace as the Nagatha A.I. I am a fan of Quinto and he has a great body of work, I just wasnt feeling it with his performance in this production. It was like his heart wasnt in it, and it came off a bit wooden. The story was a bit over the top and overemphasized military sterotypes a wee too much.Despite my minor gripes, I was entertained and enjoyed listening to, though not always ageering with, the intreptations the actors brought to each character. I would recommend it to any fan of Alanson's work and continuation of his series.",

        "reviewDescription": "I am a big fan of Alanson's Expeditionary and Extinction books, especially those narrated by R.C. Bray. However, Homefront fell short of the quality of the other books for me. It reminded me of an old time radio show whit various people stepping up to the microphone and some in the background creating the sound effects. I only got through the first 5 chapters and then gave up.",

The main cast voices not being RC Bray was something I did not expect but it was different to hear all the other characters voiced by many other actors. I would recommend getting this new addition to the expeditionary force so that you get to experience something new and different. I think if it had been a visual format it would have been amazing but in this format your imagination will be working with overtime to visualize what’s happening.",

    "bookDescription": "The Siege of Terra Book 1\nAfter years of devastating war, Horus and his forces have arrived at Terra. But before they can set foot on the Throneworld, they must first break the defences of the Sol System.\nPowerful fleets and cunning defences bar their path - but can anything hope to halt the advance of the Traitor armada?\nListen to it because:\nThe final act of the long-running, best-selling series starts here, with a brutal and uncompromising look at the first stage of the Siege of Terra, the war to conquer the solar system. Armies will fall, heroes will rise and legends will be written....\nThe Story\nAfter seven years of bitter war, the end has come at last for the conflict known infamously as the Horus Heresy. Terra now lies within the Warmaster’s sights, the Throneworld and the seat of his father’s rule. Horus’ desire is nothing less than the death of the Emperor of Mankind and the utter subjugation of the Imperium. He has become the ascendant vessel of Chaos and amassed a terrible army with which to enact his will and vengeance.\nBut the way to the Throne will be hard as the primarch Rogal Dorn, the Praetorian and protector of Terra, marshals the defences. First and foremost, Horus must challenge the might of the Sol System itself and the many fleets and bulwarks arrayed there.\nTo gain even a foothold on Terran soil, he must first contend the Solar War. Thus the first stage of the greatest conflict in the history of all mankind begins.",

What started as a terrific backstory and foundation to the 40k universe became a cash cow... We deserved better...That being said, Horus Rising was my first WH40k book and it opened a door to a virtual flood of bolter-porn and grimdark... I've loved almost all of it (Damnation of Pythos, Vulkan Lives... I can't get that time back) and John French delivers.This is a great setup for what (is hopefully) a concise conclusion to the Horus Heresy saga. Seriously, if they string this out for more than five books I'm gonna have to plan a trip to Nottingham!French appears to really care about the content and the stories that have been (and have yet to be) told... Buy his book, reward good storytelling...But get your act together Black Library! I only have a few thousand (more) dollars to spend on your books!!!",

        "reviewDescription": "Pra quem gosta de Warhammer 40k, batalhas (especialmente, batalhas no espaço), space marines fazendo coisas de space marines, e etc, vai adorar o livro. Ele é o primeiro de 8 livros da série da Siege of Terra, porém, para não ficar perdido, é necessário ler alguns dos livros da série Horus Heresy, que é a prequel deste evento.Como a Horus Heresy tem simplesmente 54 livros... sugiro estes, que são os mais necessários pra ler na minha opinião:Horus Rising, False Gods, Galaxy in Flames, Flight of the Eisenstein (estes quatro são os mais necessários pra entender todo o setting, e vários dos personagens que aparecem no The Solar War, depois eles são desenvolvidos em outros livros, mas só com estes quatro já da pra ter uma noção de tudo).Falando do livro, ele é ótimo, certamente um dos melhores de 40k que já li. Nele você tem uma visão macro da batalha pelo sistema solar, pelos olhos de vários personagens importantes, como Abaddon, Rogal Dorn, Sigismund, Jubal Khan, etc. Além disso, há uma briga não só física, na realidade, mas dentro do warp, entre o Imperador e os Chaos Gods. Neste livro você também retorna a acompanhar Mersadie Olton e Loken, protagonistas do início da Horus Heresy. Com certeza vou comprar os próximos livros da série, quando lançarem (o próximo sai neste agosto).Outros livros que recomendo da Horus Heresy, que desenvolvem os Loyalists space marines principalmente, já que tenho mais interesse neles: Shadows of Treachery, Know no Fear, Scars, Path of Heaven, Unremembered Empire, Pharos, Angels of Caliban, Praetorian of Dorn, Master of Mankind, Wolfsbane, Ruinstorm.",

Putting their own concerns aside, Garviel Loken and his loyal kinsmen lead their companies to the surface only to learn the full, horrifying truth, and the legendary war known as the Horus Heresy begins with the most foul act of betrayal imaginable...",

In a series like this where bolters and lasguns and chain sword fights are common, each assault, battle, and duel still feels fresh and exciting. There are enough twists and turns to both fulfill the foreshadowing but not make what happens next obvious. At this point of my reading there are 40+ books and I will keep reading until it becomes stale. I hope it never gets stale!",

        "reviewTitle": "Well Developed Action Tale",
        "reviewDescription": "This work is the third book in the growing series telling the tale of the Horus Heresy, a pivotal historical event in Games Workshop's Warhammer 40K fictional universe. Most of the characters from the first two novels carry through to this one: Garviel Lorken and Tarik Torgaddon of the Sons of Horus, Saul Tarvitz of the Emperor's Children, Nathanial Garro of the Death Guard, and Kyril Sindermann the remembrancer. In addition, we get appearances by a number of primarchs and other dramatis personae recognizable from the tabletop game.I have been critical of Ben Counter's work in the past, which has been short on plot even though he typically writes good action scenes. However, in this work he surpasses his earlier efforts, providing excellent character interaction worthy of Abnett along with solid action sequences throughout. Instead of writing bad, difficult to believe \"seduction by the Warp\" scenes, which tripped up Graham McNeill in the second book, he presents much of it after the fact as loyalist characters question how it all could have gone so wrong so fast - and does it well.The plot focuses on the few individuals who resist the growing tide of corruption with the Crusade, and does a credible job continuing the outstanding development started by Dan Abnett in Horus Rising. Counter follows them through the battles and conflicts that he writes so well, but still does a surprisingly solid job at depicting the creep of injustice and tyranny through Horus' forces.The weakest portion of the book is the ending, which ham-handedly forces things into position for the next author in the series (Flight of the Eisenstein by James Swallow), as well as inducing a cliffhanger of sorts.In short: generally well written and entertaining throughout, it's well worth a read for any fan of 40K novels. As an added bonus, it took away the bad taste left in my mouth after finishing False Gods.",

The Phantoms are awesome, Chuck is a riot, it's a rock 'em sock roller coaster filled with the cleverness that I really enjoy and, since this was released on St. Valentine's Day....there might even be some love in the air.  We do face some loss...there is some heroic sadness.... but this series keeps getting better - so glad to see another book will be released in April!!",

These 3 books have left me wanting more and I already have number 4 in my books to read library. Give these books a read you won't be disapointed.",

Van is a minimum of one-half Hu'warde because his Mother Jocelyn is also Hu'warde. This appears to be a grievous error made by Author Maggert. Its highly doubtful that J. N. Chaney would've made an error of this magnitude. I have read too many books in series by that Author Chaney that had no issues with continuity.  So I will lay the blame at the feet of the Secondary Author Terry Maggert, the beta readers, and the Editor. Let's not forget the AI that somehow missed the Family Tree legend in the Preview area in the front of this book.  Disappointing to read that knowing so many did not take the opportunity to update that paragraph. To await months for this book to finally arrive, makes this error absolutely difficult to digest.",

        "reviewDescription": "This book had just about everything... Warp speed! Impulse engines! Exploding consoles! and a complete absence of seatbelts! Apparently the technology for seat restraints was lost in some earlier era.Aside from that, for its length, this book did a great job of creating characters, building a story, and keeping your attention! It's a great tale of a bunch of greenies showing courage under fire, and a captain doing everything in his power to save lives! It's also a story of a bunch of young engineers rallying behind their captain and giving it all to get the job done!It's not hard sci-fi, and it's not Hamlet. But it does what it is meant to do; entertain. So if you like books that harken back to the golden years of sci-fi, with bodies flying from explosions, enemy vessels that dwarf anything the good guys have, and people facing odds that would make you crawl in an escape pod, hit the eject and self-destruct buttons at the same time, you'll like this book!",

I read the criticism on how starships will not move or react to damage the way the author depicts them, but it is a story and I actually enjoyed how they are depicted in responding to damage. It’s adds a depth of emotion to understand how they die or survive after damage similar to describing a characters facial expressions in different situations.",

        "reviewTitle": "An excellent read, albeit flawed by hard science",
        "reviewDescription": "This is an extremely well written novel, entertaining and enthralling.  It kept me engaged from the first page to the last - in fact, I enjoyed it so much that having first borrowed it on Kindle Unlimited, I then bought a copy, to give the author the benefit of double earning.  I'm looking forward to the next two books in the series.That said, the book's major flaw - and it's a big one - is that it ignores the limitations of hard science in so blatant a way as to make it difficult to suspend disbelief.  I'm not talking about standard tropes like faster-than-light travel, or that sort of thing:  almost every SF author uses them, and we're used to them.  What grates is when a spaceship can brake from speeds greater than light to a standstill in the time it takes to read this sentence, or when a spaceship is used to ram another spaceship at faster-than-light speeds.  You and I know that even the barest touch of ship upon ship at such speeds would produce one of the most stupendous explosions in the galaxy, and utterly destroy both craft;  yet, in this book, it becomes a tactic that the hero uses more than once.  At low speeds (I'm talking tens, rather than hundreds or thousands of miles per hour) ramming becomes feasible.  Any faster, and it's a non-starter (except as a rather flashy way to commit suicide).  For such flaws, I had to deduct one star from what would otherwise have been a five-star review.However, the book is still very entertaining, and I liked it enough that I've pre-ordered the next two volumes in the series.  I just wish the author would be a bit more careful in crossing the scientifically believable line!",

The action was remorseless yet gripping and with different scenarios each major event. I dare say that much didn't conform to our current understanding of physics, but it was handled in such a way that it didn't seem to matter.The central character was unexpectedly thrust into his role but rose to the occasion and became a genuine hero, a natural leader... all whilst coming across as a thoroughly pleasant character, doubts and fears not withstanding.I don't often give 5 stars but I didn't feel I could do otherwise in this case... and I am seriously considering buying the remaining 2 books in the series, although book 2 is based on a planet.",

    "bookDescription": "When a towering alien monolith crashes onto James McGill's family farm, it triggers events that could spark a galaxy-wide war.\nThings have gone bad among the colonies. Insurgents are building alien-hybrid armies and planet-killing weapons, threatening to upend the fragile balance of power in Province 921.\nThere's not only trouble in the province—the Core Worlds are igniting as well. The Mogwa have asserted claims upon the Imperial Throne, causing their rivals to move against them. Earth's Hegemony and the rebels are pulled into a conflict that could tear the galaxy apart.\nCivil War looms, and McGill has only one chance to get ahead of it. Can he bluff, fight, and lie his way through a maze of shifting loyalties and dangerous enemies?\nFind out in Rebel World, the latest entry in B. V. Larson's USA Today bestselling Undying Mercenaries series—modern military sci-fi at its finest.",

        "reviewDescription": "Though Larson is expanding his writing and adding more detail as he goes along... the overall storyline and plot are only outshined by the entertaining cast of characters led up by one... dare we say anti-hero!?Each book in the series has its own ups and downs. A general flow with witty banter and the feel of experienced veterans is all there.  In every novel. No, it's not as polished as David Weber in this genre. Nor as \"lessons learned\" and morally focused as R.A. Salvatore tends to be with Drizzit; the series is a great get-away with learning and entertainment to be found for sure! It's more than worth the read!",

        "reviewDescription": "Been a fan of the series since the beginning, and I looked forward to this latest addition. However, as I finished the book, I felt as though this story had been pieced together and it lacked cohesion. It just felt like multiple vignettes taped together to make another book.For example, I usually reread the previous book in the series so I can flow right into the new. Yet this work seemed to completely ignore what had happened between and Galina and MacGill at the end of Throne World. Their initial interactions in Rebel World seem contrary to what was just established. That is one example of many, and it made this book feel a lot more Luke a stand-alone project.Also, I am nor sure why there were little observations made by MacBook throughout this story. I don't recall this being part of his style to this point so it seemed out of character for him to notice things like little dents in someone's armor or a smudge on someone's uniform. I thought the author was developing something about the main character that would be used later in the work, but he did not. Once again, it seemed to make the read a bit disjointed.I will commend Larson for turning it around at the end by sliding back into the approach and narrative that, in my opinion, has worked so far. It actually has me interested in what happens next.An ok read that propagated the storyline ahead some, but not the most compelling narrative in the series. Hopefully the next book will return to form.",

        "reviewDescription": "After religiously keeping up with the exploits of the Undying Mercenaries through all 22 novels, I found the first third of this story distracting to the point that it was nearly unreadable. The word 'like' is used over 900 times in the novel as a simile to compare a simple description to a contrived, hillbilly analogy. As a person who grew up. in the Deep South, I found them overly embellished and hyperbolized. We don’t talk like that.For the first third of the story I wondered if the protagonist, McGill, was written by the original author. Normally conceived as an intelligent conman with questionable character, the new McGill in the first half of the book was simply a conniving fool. Elements of the story surrounding him, such as the tortured-and-revived sequence, appeared edited in from a previous story, and his interaction with other recurring characters seemed inconsistent with previous novels.But then, roughly halfway through the story, the use of similes in every description suddenly stopped, the novel smoothed out, McGill's typical character was restored. I wonder if there were an effort to use AI, if a young ghost writer wrote some of the novel, or if B.V. Larson were just having fun with the English language by stuffing in a simile behind every adjective.One loose end that I tracked was the recurring mention of the tiny scratches and marks that McGill noticed throughout the book. I kept waiting for a tiny alien, or a robotic entity, or one with a hard shell carapace to make an appearance. It dangled. Perhaps more will surface in subsequent books, just as I am awaiting more of the buried bunker hidden by earth’s patriots in the past of the storyline. So far the mere mention of that pre-war period has been verboten to the characters. Maybe that is reserved as an opportunity for a spin-off series.Good story, numerous open elements for future development, a little distracting to read.",

        "reviewDescription": "McGill is still up to his old tricks. He finds himself a star witness in several high level galactic court cases and is his usual bull in a china shop self. The grand admiral is not a character I have ever felt sympathy for but he came close in this one. No one alien or other deserves to be on the receiving end of the insidious McGill creature and his ways. Especially when he tells the truth! Earth's grip on the province of 921 is threatened by the proxy battle between the powers of the galactics and once again the legions march and die over and over. Something that kept cropping up was McGill noticing scratches, dents and minor imperfections in the people and environment around him. Is it a writing tick missed in the editing process or is it foreshadowing for events in future entries? The leadership of the legions in this series has always been completely dysfunctional and this reaches new levels in this one. Given human history and the revival tech possible in this universe it is only too believable. A long serving character also gets a long deserved promotion. I would like him to do well as compatant leadership would be a nice change for the legion.",

    "bookDescription": "When a running battle brings the Fafnir home to Earth, it ends with the death of a trusted friend—and a new focus on what comes next for Van and his crew.\nThe Guild is rotten. It must be changed. It must be healed. But to do that, Van will have to marshal resources on a scale he's never considered, and that means calling in favors from friends.\nWith the Schegith fleet in training, and the Conoku itching to get back into the fight, Van has a clear plan for what he has to do—which is the one thing he doesn't want to do.\nThe time for war is here. The time for change is now.\nA new leader is needed, and Van will discover if he can take control of Yotov's criminal empire—and save the victims across known space.",

        "reviewDescription": "The main characters of the Fafnir and their associated ‘friendlies’ / associated ‘good guys’, protecting and fighting on behalf of innocents and well deserving institutions and planets, are the most entertaining group of beings in addition to their AI advanced almost human companions, are a never ending, yet consistently individual characters assembled throughout the universe. It is the good guys against the worst guys, with all the unexpected ups and downs in imaginative situations. I thoroughly enjoy being entertained by the antics of the various characters and constantly new situations they rally to correct, improve or assist. There is plenty of humor, compassion, dedication, aggression and good vibes to keep you reading, without even mentioning the advanced technologies of all kinds. If you want to enjoy a nail biting, action packed series expertly feathered with both the good and bad guys, in ways not easily imagined, but artfully described, then this series is an absolute must. You will be constantly entertained and happy to have read each and every book!",

Even after 22 novels, there is nothing stale about the characters or the story arc.If you only read 1 science fiction series this year, choose The Backyard Starship. I plan to re-read the entire series this coming winter.Get to know Van, Torina, Perry, Netty, Netty-P, Icky, Rob, Gabby, Funboy and The Fafnir, start with book #1 and sooner than you think , you'll have read them all!",

    "bookDescription": "Siege of Terra Book 7\nWith the walls of the Imperial Palace in ruins and the end in sight, Sanguinius prepares one final stand. The loyalists are desperate, and the Warmaster’s hordes are certain of their coming victory.\nListen to it because\nThe myriad battles of the Siege of Terra series are pulling into a taut weave of tension, horror, and certain doom. Just when you thought it was bad, it gets worse.\nThe story\nThe walls have fallen. The defenders are broken. The Inner Palace lies in ruins.\nThe Warmaster’s horde advances through the fire and ash of Terra's dying breaths, forcing the loyalists back to the Delphic Battlement—the very walls of the Sanctum Imperialis. Angron, Primarch of the World Eaters and Herald of Horus, has achieved immortality through annihilation—now he leads the armies of the damned in a wrathful tide, destroying all before them as the warp begins its poisonous corruption of Terra's very soil.\nFor the Emperor’s beleaguered forces, the end has come. The Khan lies on the edge of death. Rogal Dorn is encircled, fighting his own war at Bhab Bastion. Guilliman will not reach Terra in time. Without his brothers, Sanguinius—the Angel of the Ninth Legion—waits on the final battlements, hoping to rally a desperate band of defenders and refugees for one last stand.",

        "reviewDescription": "Ka'banda, Lotara Sarrin, Angron, Vulkan, Magnus, and Sanguinius – this magnificent volume features some of the best action scenes with beloved characters from both loyal and traitor factions. With excellent use of flashbacks, Chechok’s gun foreshadowing, high stakes, and one of the most epic endings of the Horus Heresy, this is a title you won’t want to miss. The events within are fundamental to the immense lore of this franchise.This is possibly the book I’ve enjoyed most by Aaron Dembski-Bowden, and the long-awaited duel between Angron and Sanguinius is as emotionally impactful as it is physically immense in scale. The sense of loss is masterfully described, and the feats narrated here will echo for eternity in the WH40K lore, just as the title of this work promised.",

Then in all the loss there is the melding of the loyalist forces into a stoic and lethal force.  Sanguinius' defeat of his demonic brother and Ka'banda are the best part.  Read it by all means.

This is without a doubt his best novel, and has narrowly taken its place as my favorite Warhammer novel (of any of the settings), of all time.  The reality of a six month siege, with the absurd technological/metaphysical capabilities of other armies is pushed to maximum realism here.To be blunt, this book can be brutal.  There are scenes that are grotesque and tough to read but they always have a point.  Nonetheless, I ended this book feeling something.  Drained, hopeful, and haunted all at the same time.  This book is incredible.",

This novel feels like a living thing. It is heavy, I read it a chapter at a time because they were so brutal and real. If you ever thought that the followers of Chaos got off clear and free- well my friend you won't for long.The Blood Angels finally shine, if in a tragic and dark way. I want more from ADB on the Revenant Legion. The same characters we have been following (including the Howl of the Hearthworld) have their stories wrapped up, or some probably wished it was wrapped up.This novel deserves all the praise and credit it will get. ADB has outdone himself, and written what I would describe as a science fiction novel that anyone could read and love. Again, well done. I am completely impressed.",

They've already been holding on for so long.No more could and should be asked from them.But they hold on. They fight. With uniyelding defiance.Even though the outcome has already been decided by blood-thirsty monstrosities.Even though they're sorely outnumbered.They all fight. Astartes, humans, Primarchs.And the result is quite simply epic.If there was just one book of The Siege of Terra series you should read fellas, that's definitely this one.I cannot recommend that book enough.Don't straggle guys !!PS : seeing Sanguinius kicking Angron's sorry butt is absolutely priceless!",

    "bookDescription": "When aliens invade, a generations-long struggle begins against an impenetrable enemy in this sci-fi epic from the Hugo and Nebula Award–winning author.The Entities have arrived on Earth, fifteen feet tall with impenetrable defenses and inscrutable motives. As conquerors, they have no demands, no explanations, simply harsh consequences should they be challenged. Releasing a plague and plunging the world into a new Dark Age, the Entities seem unbeatable. But, one family at least—the Carmichael clan led by Colonel Anson Carmichael—will never give up the resistance.THE ALIEN YEARS is an epic story told over multiple generations by master of thoughtful science fiction Robert Silverberg. Can ideas of freedom survive in the face of an overwhelmingly powerful enemy? \"A remarkable study of human endurance and patience that belongs in most SF collections.\" —The Library Journal\"Sobering and frightening…. Silverberg's rich characters, his dead-on-target vision of modern society, his mastery at building tension—all are in evidence in this notable outing from one of the very best.\" —Publishers Weekly",

        "reviewDescription": "Robert Silverberg's The Alien Years, one of his later works, is a tale of alien invasion. Mankind can do nothing to stop the aliens, but at the same time, the aliens' intentions are inscrutable. There is minimal interaction with humanity until some human attempt at striking back place takes place. This begins as simple as stopping all electricity to a worldwide plague that kills half of humanity. Eventually things settle down with humans psychically controlled into mindless tasks with some human actively collaborating with the aliens, but never learning their true intentions. One family across several generations keeps up the fight, coordinating a worldwide resistance movement but to no avail. Eventually, after 50+ years, the aliens pick up and leave without any reason or rationale.Given the long time span, the story jumps in time and the family goes from children to young adults to elder statemen. Much time is spent displaying the multiple forms that different people adopt to accommodate and learn to live in a very different world. By the end, most of the humans alive have never lived without the alien presence signalling a new beginning for humanity.",

        "reviewDescription": "First, what I liked:Silverberg does dialogue pretty well.  That kept my attention.He also does a good job with his descriptive language.The pacing is mostly on point.Now, what I didn't like:-- A few times, things just happen and people just behave in certain ways because the plot needs them to.  I kept thinking, \"That's not how that would go down, in real life.\"-- The chapters are set up as time gaps (e.g., \"Five Years Later\", \"Ten Years Later\", etc.).  That allows Silverberg to cover a great deal of time in the book, but it comes at the expense of the characters.  We see characters as pre-teens, and then in the next chapter, they're in their 30s.  The Alien Years is a human story, but his way of telling it doesn't let us connect with the humans much.-- The ending ... It just doesn't work.  I won't go into spoilers, but I found it too abrupt.  I kind of see what he was *trying* to do, but he didn't lay the groundwork for it.",

        "reviewTitle": "A very good story about human nature while facing an undefeatable alien invasion!",
        "reviewDescription": "One day, unannounced, the Aliens arrived. Their ships caused massive destruction not by war but simply by landing and setting massive unintended fires. Mankind tried to communicate with them but their efforts were useless.  The aliens were so far advanced that we were less than ants to their technology and mental capabilities. The aliens never tried to communicate with humans but they were telepathic and could force humans to do their will by simply pushing  what they wanted done into the minds of the Earthlings.Everytime mankind tried to drive the aliens off of the Earth their efforts lasted only seconds. The aliens retaliated quickly and efficiently. The message was clear, try to hurt us and we will strike back in a million fold worse manner. The aliens were so far advanced that it was like fighting Gods……This is an excellent story. Yes it is Sci-Fi but little was told about the aliens or their technology. The story is about how mankind reacted to being so easily conquered and subjugated  by a vastly superior race. Some people became collaborators, some tried to resist and ½ of the world’s population died.No one knew who the aliens were, where they came from or what they wanted. The story is about how people lived under total domination and survived in their own way. That is what makes this story great. It is probably very close to the truth of what will happen when we finally meet a race of aliens that may be millions or billions of years more advanced than we are.I like the story and I rated it 5 stars.",
